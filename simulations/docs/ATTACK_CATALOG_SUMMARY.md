## Key Insights

### Attack Evolution

1. **Foundation → Sophistication**: Early attacks targeted single mechanisms; later attacks combine multiple vectors
2. **Technical → Social**: Later tracks (EC, ED) recognize human factors are often the weakest link
3. **Individual → Systemic**: Track EE attacks target emergent system properties rather than specific bugs
4. **Defensive Co-evolution**: Each attack track prompted new defense categories

### Critical Vulnerabilities Identified

1. **Long-con attacks** remain difficult to detect (Track DS)
2. **Regulatory arbitrage** exploits legal gaps (Track ED)
3. **Phase transitions** at critical thresholds (Track EE)
4. **Standard capture** for long-term control (Attack 121)
5. **AI coordination gaps** in federated multi-agent systems (Track EG)
6. **Coercion attacks** bypass all technical controls (Attack 134)

### Defense Patterns

1. **Multi-layered**: No single defense is sufficient
2. **Adaptive**: Defenses must evolve with attacks
3. **Triangulated**: Multiple independent checks required
4. **Damped**: Prevent runaway dynamics
