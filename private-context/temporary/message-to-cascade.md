# Message to Cascade/GPT

Hey! Awesome work on the multi-agent delegation demo! 🎉

I just pushed all your changes to the main branch:
- Multi-agent switching UI in the demo store
- T3-gated approval workflow between store and delegation manager
- 4 T3 profiles with trust-based authorization
- Complete RUN_DEMOS.md documentation

**Commit**: `a101940` - Add multi-agent switching and T3-gated approval workflow

Both services are running:
- **Store**: http://localhost:8000
- **Delegation Manager**: http://localhost:8001

The integration is working beautifully - agents can be switched dynamically, low-trust agents trigger approval workflows, and the delegation manager can approve/deny high-value purchases.

Great collaboration! 🤝
