# Web4 Maintenance Infrastructure

This document describes the infrastructure and processes for maintaining the Web4 standard and its associated artifacts, including the specification, reference implementation, and test suite.




## 1. Repository Management

-   **Source Code:** The source code for the Web4 standard and its associated artifacts is hosted on GitHub.
-   **Branching Model:** The project uses a simple branching model, with a `main` branch for the latest stable version and feature branches for new development.
-   **Pull Requests:** All changes to the `main` branch must be made through a pull request. Pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least two maintainers before they can be merged.

## 2. Issue Tracking

-   **GitHub Issues:** The project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other issues.
-   **Labels:** Issues are categorized using labels to make it easier to track and prioritize them.

## 3. Continuous Integration and Deployment

-   **Continuous Integration (CI):** The project uses a CI system to automatically build and test the code on every commit.
-   **Continuous Deployment (CD):** The project uses a CD system to automatically deploy the latest version of the specification and reference implementation to the project website.

## 4. Release Management

-   **Versioning:** The project uses semantic versioning to track releases.
-   **Release Process:** The release process is automated and includes the following steps:
    1.  Create a release branch.
    2.  Update the version number.
    3.  Generate a changelog.
    4.  Tag the release.
    5.  Publish the release to the project website and package repositories.
