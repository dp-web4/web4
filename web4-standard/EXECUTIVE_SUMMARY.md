# Web4 Standard: Executive Summary

## Vision

Web4 is the trust-native evolution of the internetâ€”a distributed intelligence architecture where every entity has verifiable presence, relationships build measurable trust, and autonomous agents operate safely within societal boundaries.

## The Web4 Equation

```
Web4 = LCTs + MRH + Trust + MCP + SAL + AGY + ACP
```

Seven foundational components that work together to create a complete trust-native infrastructure:

## Core Components

### 1. Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)
**Unforgeable Digital Presence**

Every entity in Web4â€”human, AI, device, or serviceâ€”has an LCT that serves as its cryptographically-bound identity. LCTs are not just identifiers; they are living records of an entity's existence, relationships, and reputation.

- Cryptographic binding to public keys
- Immutable creation records (birth certificates)
- Relationship tracking through MRH
- Trust accumulation via T3/V3 tensors

### 2. Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)
**Fractal Context Preservation**

Created by Dennis Palatov, MRH extends the concept of Markov blankets to explicitly encompass fractal scales. Implemented as RDF graphs, MRH maintains relevance across multiple levels of organization.

- Four relationship types: binding, pairing, witnessing, broadcast
- RDF/SPARQL for semantic queries
- Trust propagation algorithms
- Fractal composition across scales

### 3. Trust Tensors (T3/V3)
**Multidimensional Reputation**

Trust is not binary but multidimensional and role-contextual. T3 measures capability (Talent, Training, Temperament) while V3 measures outcomes (Veracity, Validity, Value).

- Role-contextual scores (trust as surgeon â‰  trust as mechanic)
- ATP-staked queries prevent reputation farming
- Temporal decay and evolution
- Evidence-based adjustments via auditors

### 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
**Inter-Entity Communication Layer**

MCP serves as the nervous system of Web4, enabling trust-aware communication between all entities. Every MCP interaction builds or erodes trust based on outcomes.

- MCP servers and clients as first-class Web4 entities
- Trust-based resource access
- ATP metering and dynamic pricing
- Session management with context preservation

### 5. Society-Authority-Law (SAL)
**Governance Framework**

Every entity is born into a society with laws, authorities, and responsibilities. SAL provides the governance structure that keeps Web4 safe and aligned.

- Birth certificates linking entities to societies
- Law Oracles publishing machine-readable rules
- Authority delegation with scoped powers
- Witness requirements for critical events
- Auditor roles for post-hoc adjustments

### 6. Agency Delegation (AGY)
**Formal Authority Transfer**

AGY enables Client entities to delegate specific authorities to Agent entities with precise scope, resource caps, and temporal bounds.

- Proof-of-agency required for all delegated actions
- Granular scope control (contexts, methods, resources)
- Immediate revocation capability
- Dual trust attribution (agent execution, client responsibility)

### 7. Agentic Context Protocol (ACP)
**Autonomous Operation Framework**

ACP transforms Web4 from reactive to agentic, enabling entities to plan, decide, and act autonomously while maintaining human oversight and accountability.

- Agent Plans with triggers and workflows
- Intent-Decision-Execution lifecycle
- Human approval gates for critical actions
- Complete audit trail on immutable ledger

## The R6 Action Framework

Every transaction in Web4 follows the R6 pattern:

```
Rules + Role + Request + Reference + Resource â†’ Result
```

This ensures every action is:
- **Complete**: Nothing ambiguous or undefined
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs produce same outputs
- **Auditable**: All actions recorded on ledger
- **Contextual**: Scoped to roles and permissions
- **Bounded**: Resource consumption limited
- **Compliant**: Follows society's laws

## Revolutionary Concepts

### Roles as First-Class Entities
Roles aren't just labelsâ€”they're entities with their own LCTs, histories, and reputations. When you take on a role, you pair with it, inheriting its context and constraints.

### Citizen Role as Birth Certificate
Every entity begins with a citizen role pairing that serves as its birth certificate. This foundational pairing is permanent and provides base rights and responsibilities.

### Trust as Gravity
Trust operates as a fundamental force in Web4. High-trust entities attract attention, resources, and opportunities. Trust literally shapes the topology of the network.

### Dictionary Entities
Living entities that bridge semantic gaps between domains, managing the trust-compression relationship inherent in translation and communication.

### Witness-Based Reality
Presence exists through witnessing. The more an entity is witnessed, the more present it becomes. Accumulated witnessing makes falsifying history exponentially harder.

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **Cryptographic**: LCT binding, HPKE encryption, signatures
2. **Social**: Witness requirements, quorum models
3. **Economic**: ATP stakes, resource caps, metering
4. **Legal**: Law Oracle compliance, society rules
5. **Temporal**: Expiration, rate limits, temporal bounds

### Trust-Based Access
Resources are gated by trust levels. Higher trust means:
- Lower costs (ATP pricing)
- Greater access (resource quotas)
- Reduced friction (fewer witnesses required)
- Increased autonomy (higher approval thresholds)

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy LCTs and basic MRH
2. **Phase 2**: Add trust tensors and witnessing
3. **Phase 3**: Implement SAL governance
4. **Phase 4**: Enable agency delegation
5. **Phase 5**: Activate autonomous agents

## The Web4 Difference

Unlike Web3's focus on financial sovereignty through blockchain, Web4 focuses on **trust sovereignty** through verifiable relationships. Where Web3 asks "who owns this?", Web4 asks "who trusts whom, in what context, and why?"

This shift from ownership to relationship, from transaction to interaction, from consensus to context, creates an internet where:

- **Identity is unforgeable** but privacy-preserving
- **Trust is measurable** but context-specific
- **Agents are autonomous** but accountable
- **Governance is decentralized** but effective
- **Intelligence is distributed** but coordinated

## Summary

Web4 isn't just an upgradeâ€”it's a fundamental reimagining of how digital entities interact. By making trust explicit, measurable, and contextual, Web4 creates the foundation for a new kind of internet where humans and AIs collaborate safely, organizations coordinate efficiently, and societies govern effectively.

The standard is now feature-complete and ready for implementation. Early adopters can begin with basic components and gradually add advanced features as their needs evolve.
