# Web4 Standard Document Structure

This document outlines the proposed hierarchical structure for the Web4 Internet Standard. The structure is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to navigate, drawing inspiration from best practices in modern RFCs and web standards.

## 1. Introduction

- **1.1. Purpose:** A clear and concise statement of the standard's goals and objectives.
- **1.2. Scope:** The boundaries of the standard, what it covers, and what it does not.
- **1.3. Terminology:** A glossary of terms, definitions, and notational conventions used throughout the document.
- **1.4. Architecture Overview:** A high-level overview of the Web4 architecture, its components, and their interactions.

## 2. Core Concepts

- **2.1. Web4 Entities:** Definition of the fundamental entities in the Web4 ecosystem (e.g., users, nodes, services).
- **2.2. Trust Relationships:** The model for establishing and managing trust between entities.
- **2.3. Digital Pairing:** The process of creating secure relationships between entities.
- **2.4. Witnessing and Notarization:** The mechanism for third-party verification and validation.

## 3. Protocol Specifications

- **3.1. Handshake and Pairing Protocol:** The protocol for establishing initial contact and pairing between entities.
- **3.2. Messaging Protocol:** The format and protocol for exchanging messages between entities.
- **3.3. Data and Credential Formats:** The structure and encoding of data and credentials used in the protocol.
- **3.4. URI Scheme:** The definition of the `web4://` URI scheme.

## 4. Security Framework

- **4.1. Cryptographic Primitives:** The required and recommended cryptographic algorithms.
- **4.2. Key Management:** Guidelines for key generation, storage, and rotation.
- **4.3. Authentication and Authorization:** Mechanisms for verifying entity identity and access control.
- **4.4. Security Considerations:** A comprehensive analysis of potential threats and mitigations.

## 5. Extensibility

- **5.1. Extension Mechanism:** The framework for extending the protocol with new features and capabilities.
- **5.2. Subprotocol Negotiation:** A mechanism for negotiating and using subprotocols.
- **5.3. IANA Considerations:** Guidelines for registering new extensions and parameters.

## 6. Implementation Guidance

- **6.1. Reference Implementation:** A guide to a reference implementation of the standard.
- **6.2. Conformance Testing:** A suite of tests for verifying compliance with the standard.
- **6.3. Interoperability:** Guidelines for ensuring interoperability between different implementations.

## Appendices

- **A. ASN.1/JSON Schema Definitions:** Formal definitions of data structures.
- **B. Examples:** Concrete examples of protocol interactions and data formats.
- **C. References:** Normative and informative references.
