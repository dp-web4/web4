# Nova's Further Review Summary

*Date: 2025-09-14*

## Executive Summary

Nova's assessment: The Web4 standard is **real and implementable**, with proper spec hygiene and concrete operational details. Key strengths include legible crypto, fused identity/context, concrete MRH implementation, and energy metering examples.

## Key Strengths Identified

1. **Legible crypto & transport**: Clear cipher suites (X25519/Ed25519/ChaCha/HPKE), implementable
2. **Identity & context fused**: W4ID + LCT provides "who + in-what-context" as signed unit
3. **Concrete context graph**: MRH is literally lists/graphs, not hand-wavy concepts
4. **Operational trust/value**: T3/V3 with update/decay mechanics spelled out
5. **Energy angle**: Metering flow connects to "de-resource bad actors" enforcement
6. **Standards discipline**: RFC-style MUST/SHOULD/MAY, proper spec hygiene

## High-Impact Questions to Address

1. **Interoperability**: How does W4ID/LCT align with W3C DID/VC, SD-JWT, DIDComm?
2. **Threat model**: Need formal model for replay, Sybil, MRH poisoning, DoS attacks
3. **Privacy governance**: T3/V3 as reputation needs privacy scopes, appeal processes
4. **Extension/versioning**: Registry needed with breaking vs non-breaking change rules
5. **Test vectors**: Handshake transcripts, signature examples, canonicalization rules
6. **MRH scale limits**: Bounds on horizon depth/width for edge devices

## Quick Wins (Immediate Actions)

- [x] Create this summary document
- [ ] Add JSON Schemas for LCT, W4ID, MRH, T3/V3, errors
- [ ] Publish 3 test vectors for handshake
- [ ] Hello-Web4 demo (5-minute runnable)
- [ ] Conformance smoke tests
- [ ] T3/V3 guardrails page ("no global score" stance)

## Bigger Rocks (Adoption Drivers)

- [ ] Threat model document + security review
- [ ] Reference implementation in Rust/Go
- [ ] Interop note mapping to DID/VC
- [ ] Energy/compute metering demo with de-resource scenario

## Executive One-Liner

> **Web4** standardizes *verifiable context*: signed **LCTs** carrying **MRH** relationship horizons and **T3/V3** trust/value tensors, negotiated over an HPKE handshake. It's identity + context + metering in an edge-ready spec.

## GitHub Issues Created

Nova provided 10 ready-to-paste GitHub issues:
1. Add JSON Schemas for core objects
2. Publish cryptographic test vectors
3. Threat model v1
4. Conformance smoke tests
5. Interop note: W4ID/LCT â†” DID/VC mapping
6. Privacy & governance for T3/V3
7. Extension registry & versioning policy
8. Reference "Hello-Web4" demo
9. MRH scale limits & serialization strategy
10. Energy/compute metering demo

## Next Steps

1. Implement Hello-Web4 demo (in progress)
2. Create JSON schemas for validation
3. Add test vectors with fixed keys/nonces
4. Document threat model
5. Clarify DID/VC interop stance
