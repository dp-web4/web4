# Web4 Security Framework

This document defines the security framework for the Web4 standard. It covers the cryptographic primitives, key management, authentication and authorization, and a comprehensive analysis of security considerations.




## 1. Cryptographic Primitives

The security of the Web4 protocol relies on a set of well-established and secure cryptographic primitives. This section specifies the required and recommended algorithms for digital signatures, key exchange, and encryption.

### 1.1. Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of messages and credentials. Web4 implementations MUST support the following digital signature algorithm:

-   **ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256:** Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash function.

Implementations MAY support other signature algorithms, such as RSA, but ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256 is the baseline for interoperability.

### 1.2. Key Exchange

Key exchange is used to establish a shared secret between two entities. Web4 implementations MUST support the following key exchange algorithm:

-   **ECDH with P-256:** Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman with the P-256 curve.

### 1.3. Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption is used to encrypt messages and data. Web4 implementations MUST support the following symmetric encryption algorithm:

-   **AES-256-GCM:** Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode.




## 2. Key Management

Proper key management is crucial for the security of the Web4 protocol. This section provides guidelines for key generation, storage, and rotation.

### 2.1. Key Generation

Web4 entities MUST generate their own key pairs. The key generation process MUST use a secure random number generator.

### 2.2. Key Storage

Private keys MUST be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. Recommended storage methods include:

-   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** For the highest level of security, private keys should be stored in an HSM.
-   **Secure Enclaves:** On devices that support it, private keys can be stored in a secure enclave, such as the Secure Enclave on Apple devices or the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Android devices.
-   **Encrypted Storage:** If an HSM or secure enclave is not available, private keys should be stored in an encrypted format, with the encryption key protected by a strong password or other authentication mechanism.

### 2.3. Key Rotation

To mitigate the risk of key compromise, Web4 entities SHOULD rotate their keys periodically. The key rotation process involves generating a new key pair and updating the entity's Web4 Identifier to use the new public key.




## 3. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization are essential for controlling access to Web4 resources and services. This section describes the mechanisms for verifying the identity of entities and determining their access rights.

### 3.1. Authentication

Authentication in Web4 is based on digital signatures. An entity authenticates itself by signing a challenge with its private key. The signature can then be verified by the other party using the entity's public key.

### 3.2. Authorization

Authorization in Web4 is based on Verifiable Credentials (VCs). A VC is a digitally signed credential that contains a set of claims about an entity. These claims can be used to determine the entity's access rights to a particular resource or service.

For example, a VC could be used to grant an entity access to a specific API, or to prove that the entity is over a certain age.
