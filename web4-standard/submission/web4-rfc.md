# Web4 Extensibility Framework

This document defines the framework for extending the Web4 protocol. A robust extensibility model is crucial for the long-term success and evolution of the standard, allowing for the introduction of new features and capabilities without breaking backward compatibility.

## 1. Extension Mechanism

Web4 extensions are defined as optional additions to the core protocol. Implementations are not required to support any extensions, but they MUST be able to parse and ignore any unknown extensions gracefully.

### 1.1. Extension Negotiation

Extensions are negotiated during the handshake and pairing process. A client MAY include a list of supported extensions in its initial handshake message. The server then responds with a list of extensions that it supports and wishes to use for the current session.

### 1.2. Extension Structure

Each extension is defined by a unique identifier and a set of parameters. The identifier is a short, human-readable string, and the parameters are defined in a key-value format.

## 2. Subprotocol Negotiation

Web4 supports the concept of subprotocols, which are application-level protocols layered on top of the core Web4 protocol. Subprotocols allow for the creation of specialized protocols for specific use cases.

### 2.1. Subprotocol Negotiation

Subprotocols are negotiated during the handshake and pairing process, similar to extensions. A client MAY include a list of supported subprotocols in its initial handshake message. The server then selects one of the proposed subprotocols to use for the session.

## 3. IANA Considerations

To ensure interoperability and prevent collisions, all Web4 extensions and subprotocols MUST be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

### 3.1. Extension Registry

A new IANA registry will be created for Web4 extensions. The registry will include the extension identifier, a brief description, and a reference to the relevant specification.

### 3.2. Subprotocol Registry

A new IANA registry will be created for Web4 subprotocols. The registry will include the subprotocol identifier, a brief description, and a reference to the relevant specification.


# Web4 Core Protocol Specification

This document provides the detailed specification for the Web4 core protocol, including the handshake and pairing process, messaging protocol, data formats, and URI scheme.




## 1. Handshake and Pairing Protocol

The Web4 handshake and pairing protocol is the process by which two Web4 entities establish a secure communication channel and create a persistent, trusted relationship. This protocol is designed to be secure, efficient, and flexible, allowing for a variety of pairing methods.

### 1.1. Protocol Overview

The pairing process consists of the following phases:

1.  **Discovery:** One entity discovers the other, either through a direct connection, a discovery service, or by scanning a QR code.
2.  **Handshake:** The two entities perform a cryptographic handshake to establish a secure channel and exchange their public keys.
3.  **Pairing:** The entities exchange and store their respective Web4 identifiers and public keys, creating a persistent pairing.
4.  **Witnessing (Optional):** A third-party witness may be involved to notarize the pairing, adding an extra layer of trust.

### 1.2. Handshake Messages

The handshake process involves the exchange of the following messages:

-   **ClientHello:** The initiating entity (client) sends a `ClientHello` message to the responding entity (server). This message includes the client's public key and a list of supported cryptographic algorithms.
-   **ServerHello:** The server responds with a `ServerHello` message, which includes its public key and the selected cryptographic algorithm.
-   **ClientFinished:** The client sends a `ClientFinished` message, which is encrypted with the server's public key and contains a signature of the handshake messages.
-   **ServerFinished:** The server responds with a `ServerFinished` message, which is encrypted with the client's public key and contains a signature of the handshake messages.

### 1.3. Pairing Methods

Web4 supports multiple pairing methods to accommodate different use cases:

-   **Direct Pairing:** Two entities connect directly and perform the handshake and pairing protocol.
-   **Mediated Pairing:** A trusted third-party mediator facilitates the pairing process between two entities that cannot connect directly.
-   **QR Code Pairing:** One entity displays a QR code containing its Web4 identifier and public key, which the other entity scans to initiate the pairing process.




## 2. Messaging Protocol

Once a secure channel has been established, Web4 entities can exchange messages. The Web4 messaging protocol is designed to be simple, efficient, and extensible, supporting a variety of message types and content formats.

### 2.1. Message Structure

A Web4 message consists of a header and a payload:

-   **Header:** The header contains metadata about the message, such as the message type, content type, and a unique message identifier.
-   **Payload:** The payload contains the actual content of the message, which can be in any format, including plain text, JSON, or binary data.

### 2.2. Message Types

Web4 defines a set of standard message types to support common interactions:

-   **`request`:** A message that requests an action or information from the recipient.
-   **`response`:** A message that responds to a `request` message.
-   **`event`:** A message that notifies the recipient of an event or a change in state.
-   **`credential`:** A message that contains a verifiable credential.

### 2.3. Message Encryption

All Web4 messages MUST be encrypted using the keys established during the handshake and pairing process. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the communication.




## 3. Data and Credential Formats

Web4 defines a set of standard data and credential formats to ensure interoperability between different implementations. These formats are based on existing open standards, such as JSON and JSON-LD, and are designed to be extensible and flexible.

### 3.1. Web4 Identifier (W4ID)

A Web4 Identifier (W4ID) is a globally unique identifier for a Web4 entity. It is based on the Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification from the W3C and has the following format:

`w4id:<method-name>:<method-specific-id>`

-   **`w4id`:** The URI scheme for Web4 Identifiers.
-   **`<method-name>`:** The name of the method used to create and manage the identifier (e.g., `key`, `web`).
-   **`<method-specific-id>`:** A method-specific identifier.

### 3.2. Verifiable Credentials

Web4 uses Verifiable Credentials (VCs) as defined by the W3C to represent claims and attestations. VCs are digitally signed credentials that can be verified by any party.

### 3.3. JSON-LD

Web4 uses JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data) to represent data in a structured and interoperable way. JSON-LD allows for the use of semantic vocabularies, such as Schema.org, to describe the meaning of the data.




## 4. URI Scheme

The Web4 URI scheme provides a way to identify and locate Web4 resources. The scheme is based on the standard URI syntax defined in RFC 3986 and is designed to be flexible and extensible.

### 4.1. Syntax

The Web4 URI scheme has the following syntax:

`web4://<w4id>/<path-abempty>[?query][#fragment]`

-   **`web4://`:** The scheme identifier.
-   **`<w4id>`:** The Web4 Identifier of the entity that owns the resource.
-   **`<path-abempty>`:** An optional path to the resource.
-   **`[?query]`:** An optional query string.
-   **`[#fragment]`:** An optional fragment identifier.

### 4.2. Resolution

To resolve a Web4 URI, the client first resolves the W4ID to obtain the entity's service endpoint. The client then sends a request to the service endpoint, including the path, query, and fragment from the URI.


# Web4 Security Framework

This document defines the security framework for the Web4 standard. It covers the cryptographic primitives, key management, authentication and authorization, and a comprehensive analysis of security considerations.




## 1. Cryptographic Primitives

The security of the Web4 protocol relies on a set of well-established and secure cryptographic primitives. This section specifies the required and recommended algorithms for digital signatures, key exchange, and encryption.

### 1.1. Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of messages and credentials. Web4 implementations MUST support the following digital signature algorithm:

-   **ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256:** Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash function.

Implementations MAY support other signature algorithms, such as RSA, but ECDSA with P-256 and SHA-256 is the baseline for interoperability.

### 1.2. Key Exchange

Key exchange is used to establish a shared secret between two entities. Web4 implementations MUST support the following key exchange algorithm:

-   **ECDH with P-256:** Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman with the P-256 curve.

### 1.3. Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption is used to encrypt messages and data. Web4 implementations MUST support the following symmetric encryption algorithm:

-   **AES-256-GCM:** Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key in Galois/Counter Mode.




## 2. Key Management

Proper key management is crucial for the security of the Web4 protocol. This section provides guidelines for key generation, storage, and rotation.

### 2.1. Key Generation

Web4 entities MUST generate their own key pairs. The key generation process MUST use a secure random number generator.

### 2.2. Key Storage

Private keys MUST be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. Recommended storage methods include:

-   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** For the highest level of security, private keys should be stored in an HSM.
-   **Secure Enclaves:** On devices that support it, private keys can be stored in a secure enclave, such as the Secure Enclave on Apple devices or the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Android devices.
-   **Encrypted Storage:** If an HSM or secure enclave is not available, private keys should be stored in an encrypted format, with the encryption key protected by a strong password or other authentication mechanism.

### 2.3. Key Rotation

To mitigate the risk of key compromise, Web4 entities SHOULD rotate their keys periodically. The key rotation process involves generating a new key pair and updating the entity's Web4 Identifier to use the new public key.




## 3. Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization are essential for controlling access to Web4 resources and services. This section describes the mechanisms for verifying the identity of entities and determining their access rights.

### 3.1. Authentication

Authentication in Web4 is based on digital signatures. An entity authenticates itself by signing a challenge with its private key. The signature can then be verified by the other party using the entity's public key.

### 3.2. Authorization

Authorization in Web4 is based on Verifiable Credentials (VCs). A VC is a digitally signed credential that contains a set of claims about an entity. These claims can be used to determine the entity's access rights to a particular resource or service.

For example, a VC could be used to grant an entity access to a specific API, or to prove that the entity is over a certain age.


# Web4 Data Formats

This document specifies the data formats used in the Web4 protocol. These formats are designed to be flexible, extensible, and interoperable, leveraging existing open standards where possible.




## 1. Web4 Identifier (W4ID)

A Web4 Identifier (W4ID) is a globally unique identifier for a Web4 entity, compliant with the W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification [1]. It provides a standard way to identify and locate Web4 entities in a decentralized manner.

### 1.1. Syntax

The W4ID has the following ABNF syntax:

`w4id = "did:web4:" method-name ":" method-specific-id`

- **`did:web4`**: The scheme and method prefix for Web4 Identifiers.
- **`method-name`**: The name of the method used to create and manage the identifier (e.g., `key`, `web`).
- **`method-specific-id`**: A method-specific identifier string.

### 1.2. Methods

Web4 defines the following methods for creating and managing W4IDs:

- **`key` method:** The `method-specific-id` is a public key, providing a simple and self-certifying identifier.
- **`web` method:** The `method-specific-id` is a domain name, allowing for the use of existing web infrastructure to host the W4ID document.

## 2. Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

Web4 uses Verifiable Credentials (VCs) as defined by the W3C [2] to represent claims and attestations. VCs are a standard way to create and verify digital credentials that are tamper-evident and cryptographically verifiable.

### 2.1. VC Structure

A Web4 VC is a JSON object that includes the following properties:

- **`@context`**: The JSON-LD context, which defines the vocabulary used in the credential.
- **`id`**: A unique identifier for the credential.
- **`type`**: The type of the credential (e.g., `VerifiableCredential`, `Web4Credential`).
- **`issuer`**: The W4ID of the entity that issued the credential.
- **`issuanceDate`**: The date and time when the credential was issued.
- **`credentialSubject`**: The subject of the credential, which is the entity that the claims are about.
- **`proof`**: A digital signature that proves the authenticity and integrity of the credential.

## 3. JSON-LD

Web4 uses JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data) [3] to represent data in a structured and interoperable way. JSON-LD allows for the use of semantic vocabularies, such as Schema.org [4], to describe the meaning of the data, making it machine-readable and easy to process.

### 3.1. Context

Every Web4 message and credential that uses JSON-LD MUST include a `@context` property. The context can be a URL pointing to a JSON-LD context file, or an inline JSON object.

from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

# Generate a private key using the SECP256R1 curve
private_key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP256R1(), default_backend())
public_key = private_key.public_key()
```

### 2.2. W4ID Generation

Generate a Web4 Identifier from the public key:

```python
import hashlib
import base64
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

# Serialize the public key
public_key_bytes = public_key.public_bytes(
    encoding=serialization.Encoding.X962,
    format=serialization.PublicFormat.UncompressedPoint
)

# Create a hash of the public key
key_hash = hashlib.sha256(public_key_bytes).digest()

# Create the W4ID
key_id = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(key_hash[:16]).decode().rstrip('=')
w4id = f"did:web4:key:{key_id}"
```

### 2.3. Handshake Implementation

Implement the handshake protocol:

1. **ClientHello:** Send initial handshake message
2. **ServerHello:** Respond with server's public key
3. **Key Exchange:** Perform ECDH to establish shared secret
4. **ClientFinished/ServerFinished:** Complete the handshake

### 2.4. Message Encryption

Encrypt messages using AES-256-GCM:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
import uuid

# Use the shared secret as the encryption key
aesgcm = AESGCM(session_key)
nonce = uuid.uuid4().bytes[:12]  # 96-bit nonce

# Encrypt the message
ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plaintext.encode(), None)
```
