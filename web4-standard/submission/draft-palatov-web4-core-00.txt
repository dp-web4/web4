        Web4: Trust-Native Distributed Intelligence Architecture
                    draft-palatov-web4-core-00

Abstract

   This document specifies Web4, a trust-native distributed
   intelligence architecture that enables verifiable context
   preservation, decentralized coordination, and semantic
   interoperability across AI systems and traditional computing
   infrastructure. Web4 introduces nine foundational components:
   Linked Context Tokens (LCTs) for unforgeable identity, Markov
   Relevancy Horizon (MRH) for fractal context, multidimensional
   Trust tensors, Model Context Protocol (MCP) for communication,
   Society-Authority-Law (SAL) governance, Agency Delegation (AGY),
   Agentic Context Protocol (ACP), Alignment Transfer Protocol
   (ATP/ADP) value cycle, and Dictionary entities for semantic
   bridging. Together, these create an architecture where trust
   emerges from witnessed interactions rather than central
   authorities.

Internet-Draft                   Web4                    September 2025


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   The current internet architecture faces fundamental challenges in
   establishing trust, preserving context, and enabling meaningful
   coordination between humans and AI systems. Centralized platforms
   control identity, reputation is siloed and non-portable, and there
   is no native mechanism for verifiable trust without intermediaries.

   Web4 addresses these challenges by creating a trust-native
   architecture where:

   o  Every entity has an unforgeable digital presence through Linked
      Context Tokens (LCTs)

   o  Trust emerges from accumulated witnessed interactions rather
      than central declaration

   o  Context is preserved across interactions through Markov
      Relevancy Horizons (MRH)

   o  Value flows through productive work rather than accumulation
      via the ATP/ADP cycle

   o  Semantic gaps are bridged by living Dictionary entities

1.2.  The Web4 Equation

   Web4 is defined by nine foundational components:

   Web4 = LCTs + MRH + Trust + MCP + SAL + AGY + ACP + ATP + Dict

   Where:
   o  LCTs: Linked Context Tokens (unforgeable identity)
   o  MRH: Markov Relevancy Horizon (fractal context)
   o  Trust: T3/V3 tensors (multidimensional reputation)
   o  MCP: Model Context Protocol (inter-entity communication)
   o  SAL: Society-Authority-Law (governance framework)
   o  AGY: Agency Delegation (authority transfer)
   o  ACP: Agentic Context Protocol (autonomous operation)
   o  ATP: Alignment Transfer Protocol (value cycle)
   o  Dict: Dictionary Entities (semantic bridges)

1.3.  Design Goals

   Web4 aims to:

   1. Enable verifiable trust without central authorities
   2. Preserve context across all interactions
   3. Support autonomous agent operation with accountability
   4. Create an economy based on contribution rather than accumulation
   5. Bridge semantic gaps between domains and systems
   6. Scale fractally from individuals to global networks

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
   "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   Entity: Anything with presence that can hold an LCT - humans, AIs,
           organizations, devices, services, roles, or tasks.

   LCT: Linked Context Token - an unforgeable cryptographic identity
        bound to an entity.

   MRH: Markov Relevancy Horizon - the fractal context boundary that
        defines what is relevant to an entity.

   T3: Trust Tensor measuring Talent, Training, and Temperament.

   V3: Value Tensor measuring Veracity, Validity, and Value.

   R6: Action framework where Rules + Role + Request + Reference +
       Resource leads to Result.

   ATP: Alignment Transfer Protocol token in charged state.

   ADP: Alignment Discharge Protocol token in discharged state.

   Society: A delegative entity that can issue citizenship and
            establish laws.

   Dictionary: An entity that bridges semantic gaps between domains.

3.  Architecture Overview

3.1.  Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)

   An LCT is the foundational identity primitive in Web4, providing
   unforgeable digital presence for any entity.

   Structure:
   {
     "lct_id": "lct:web4:entity:alice:2025",
     "entity_type": "human",
     "binding": {
       "public_key": "Ed25519:base64...",
       "created_at": "2025-09-15T12:00:00Z",
       "binding_proof": "signature..."
     },
     "mrh": {
       "bound": [],     // Parent relationships
       "paired": [],    // Peer relationships
       "witnessing": [] // Observation relationships
     }
   }

   Key Properties:
   o  Cryptographically bound to entity
   o  Cannot be transferred or sold
   o  Accumulates reputation through use
   o  Maintains relationship graph

   Lifecycle:
   1. Creation: Entity generates keypair and binding proof
   2. Birth Certificate: Paired with citizen role in a society
   3. Evolution: Accumulates relationships and reputation
   4. Termination: Marked as void but history preserved

3.2.  Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)

   MRH extends Markov blankets to fractal scales, maintaining context
   across multiple levels of organization. Implemented as RDF graphs
   with SPARQL query capability.

   Relationship Types:
   o  Binding: Permanent parent-child (Organization -> Role)
   o  Pairing: Authorized peer-to-peer (Human <-> AI)
   o  Witnessing: Trust-building observation (Witness -> Action)
   o  Broadcast: Public announcement (Entity -> Network)

   RDF Representation:
   @prefix web4: <https://web4.io/ontology#> .
   
   lct:alice web4:pairedWith lct:bob .
   lct:alice web4:witnessing lct:transaction123 .
   lct:org web4:binds lct:role .

   Trust Propagation:
   Trust flows through MRH edges with configurable models:
   o  Multiplicative: trust_path = product(edge_weights)
   o  Probabilistic: trust_path = 1 - product(1 - edge_weights)
   o  Maximal: trust_path = min(edge_weights)

3.3.  Trust Tensors (T3/V3)

   Multidimensional, role-contextual reputation scores.

   T3 (Capability):
   o  Talent: Innate abilities (0.0 - 1.0)
   o  Training: Learned skills (0.0 - 1.0)
   o  Temperament: Behavioral consistency (0.0 - 1.0)

   V3 (Outcomes):
   o  Veracity: Truthfulness of claims (0.0 - 1.0)
   o  Validity: Correctness of actions (0.0 - 1.0)
   o  Value: Worth created (unbounded positive)

   Role Context:
   Trust is always contextual to roles. An entity's trust as a
   surgeon is independent of their trust as a pilot.

   Query Requirements:
   Trust queries MUST be ATP-staked to prevent reputation farming.
   The stake is consumed only if the querier engages with the target.

3.4.  Model Context Protocol (MCP)

   MCP provides the inter-entity communication layer, where every
   interaction affects trust.

   Message Structure:
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "method": "tools/call",
     "params": {...},
     "web4_context": {
       "sender_lct": "lct:web4:client:...",
       "sender_role": "web4:Developer",
       "trust_context": {
         "t3_in_role": {...},
         "atp_stake": 50
       },
       "proof_of_agency": {...}
     }
   }

   Trust-Based Access:
   1. Verify entity LCT
   2. Check trust requirements
   3. Validate ATP stake
   4. Verify agency delegation if present
   5. Execute with metering
   6. Update trust tensors

3.5.  Society-Authority-Law (SAL)

   Every entity is born into a society that provides governance.

   Society Components:
   o  Law Oracle: Publishes machine-readable laws
   o  Authority: Delegated powers with scope
   o  Citizens: Entities with base rights/responsibilities
   o  Witnesses: Attestation providers

   Birth Certificate:
   The first pairing with a citizen role, providing:
   o  Society membership
   o  Initial rights and responsibilities
   o  Law version binding
   o  Witness attestations

Internet-Draft                   Web4                    September 2025


3.6.  Agency Delegation (AGY)

   Formal mechanism for authority transfer from Client to Agent.

   Grant Structure:
   {
     "grantId": "agy:...",
     "client": "lct:web4:entity:CLIENT",
     "agent": "lct:web4:entity:AGENT",
     "scope": {
       "contexts": ["finance:payments"],
       "resourceCaps": {"max_atp": 25},
       "methods": ["approve", "review"]
     },
     "expiresAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
   }

   Every agent action MUST include proof-of-agency referencing a
   valid grant.

3.7.  Agentic Context Protocol (ACP)

   Enables autonomous agent operation with human oversight.

   Components:
   o  Agent Plans: Declarative workflows with triggers
   o  Intents: Proposed actions from plan evaluation
   o  Decisions: Human/automated approval
   o  Execution Records: Immutable audit trail

   Safety Mechanisms:
   o  Agency grants required
   o  Law compliance verification
   o  Human approval gates
   o  Witness attestations
   o  Resource caps

3.8.  ATP/ADP Value Cycle

   Economic system inspired by biological ATP/ADP energy cycle.

   Token States:
   o  ATP: Charged state, ready for work
   o  ADP: Discharged state, depleted

   Key Properties:
   o  Semifungible (two states only)

Internet-Draft                   Web4                    September 2025


   o  Cannot be accumulated (society pools only)
   o  Demurrage prevents hoarding
   o  Value creation through charging (ADP -> ATP)
   o  Work consumes ATP (ATP -> ADP)

3.9.  Dictionary Entities

   Living entities that bridge semantic gaps.

   Core Principle:
   All meaningful communication is compression plus trust across
   shared or sufficiently aligned latent fields.

   Functions:
   o  Translate between domains with confidence tracking
   o  Measure semantic degradation
   o  Evolve through community curation
   o  Build reputation through successful translations

4.  Protocol Specifications

4.1.  LCT Structure

   LCTs use JSON-LD with cryptographic signatures.

   Minimal LCT:
   {
     "@context": "https://web4.io/contexts/lct.jsonld",
