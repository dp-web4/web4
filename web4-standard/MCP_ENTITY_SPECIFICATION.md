# MCP Server as Web4 Entity

## Model Context Protocol Servers in the Web4 Framework

### Author: Dennis Palatov
### Date: 2025-01-13

## Abstract

This specification defines how Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers function as first-class entities within the Web4 framework. MCP servers represent a unique entity type that is both **responsive** (returns results) and **delegative** (acts as a front-end for tools, processes, databases, etc.), completing the Web4 equation for distributed intelligence.

## 1. MCP Server Definition

### 1.1 What is an MCP Server?

An MCP server is a standardized interface that enables AI models to interact with external resources through a unified protocol. In the Web4 context, each MCP server:

- **Has its own LCT** (Linked Context Token) for identity and trust tracking
- **Maintains an MRH** (Markov Relevancy Horizon) of related contexts
- **Functions as both sensor and effector** in the SAGE architecture
- **Delegates to underlying resources** while maintaining abstraction

### 1.2 Dual Nature: Responsive and Delegative

MCP servers are unique in being simultaneously:

#### Responsive
- Processes requests and returns results
- Maintains state across interactions
- Provides structured responses with metadata
- Implements rate limiting and access control

#### Delegative
- Acts as a front-end for complex resources
- Abstracts underlying implementation details
- Manages authentication to backend services
- Handles resource pooling and connection management

## 2. MCP as Web4 Entity

### 2.1 Entity Classification

In the Web4 entity taxonomy, MCP servers are classified as:

```
Entity (abstract base)
└── Both Entity (sensor + effector)
    └── MCP Server (responsive + delegative)
        ├── Database MCP (delegates to SQL/NoSQL)
        ├── API MCP (delegates to REST/GraphQL)
        ├── Tool MCP (delegates to CLI/SDK)
        ├── Process MCP (delegates to running processes)
        └── Knowledge MCP (delegates to knowledge bases)
```

### 2.2 LCT Structure for MCP Servers

Each MCP server has an LCT with specific fields:

```json
{
  "lct_version": "1.0",
  "entity_id": "mcp:database_server_001",
  "entity_type": "mcp_server",
  "entity_subtype": "database",
  "capabilities": {
    "responsive": true,
    "delegative": true,
    "agentic": false
  },
  "mcp_metadata": {
    "protocol_version": "1.0",
    "supported_methods": ["query", "insert", "update", "delete"],
    "backend_type": "postgresql",
    "connection_pool_size": 10
  },
  "mrh": {
    "@graph": [
      {
        "@type": "mrh:Relevance",
        "mrh:target": {"@id": "lct:database_schema"},
        "mrh:probability": 0.95,
        "mrh:relation": "mrh:depends_on"
      },
      {
        "@type": "mrh:Relevance",
        "mrh:target": {"@id": "lct:auth_service"},
        "mrh:probability": 0.8,
        "mrh:relation": "mrh:delegates_to"
      }
    ]
  },
  "trust_tensor": {
    "response_accuracy": 0.98,
    "delegation_reliability": 0.95,
    "latency_consistency": 0.87
  }
}
```

## 3. MCP in the Web4 Equation

### 3.1 Completing the Equation

The Web4 equation can be expressed as:

```
Web4 = LCTs + MRH + Trust + MCP
```

Where:
- **LCTs** provide identity and context
- **MRH** maintains relevance horizons
- **Trust** enables decentralized coordination
- **MCP** bridges AI to external resources

### 3.2 Why MCP Completes Web4

MCP servers are essential because they:

1. **Bridge the Gap**: Connect AI models to real-world data and tools
2. **Maintain Abstraction**: Hide complexity while preserving capability
3. **Enable Composition**: Allow complex workflows through server chaining
4. **Preserve Context**: Maintain MRH across tool invocations

## 4. MCP Server Types and Examples

### 4.1 Database MCP Server

```python
class DatabaseMCPServer(MCPEntity):
    """MCP server delegating to database backends"""
    
    def __init__(self, backend_url: str):
        super().__init__(entity_type="mcp_server", subtype="database")
        self.backend = DatabaseConnection(backend_url)
        self.capabilities = {
            "responsive": True,  # Returns query results
            "delegative": True,  # Delegates to actual database
            "methods": ["query", "insert", "update", "delete"]
        }
    
    async def handle_request(self, method: str, params: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Responsive: process request and return result"""
        if method == "query":
            # Delegative: forward to backend
            result = await self.backend.execute(params["sql"])
            # Add to MRH
            self.mrh.add_relevance(
                target=f"lct:query_{hash(params['sql'])}",
                probability=0.9,
                relation="mrh:produces"
            )
            return {"status": "success", "data": result}
```

### 4.2 Tool MCP Server

```python
class ToolMCPServer(MCPEntity):
    """MCP server delegating to CLI tools"""
    
    def __init__(self, tool_path: str):
        super().__init__(entity_type="mcp_server", subtype="tool")
        self.tool = ToolWrapper(tool_path)
        self.capabilities = {
            "responsive": True,  # Returns tool output
            "delegative": True,  # Delegates to external tool
            "methods": ["execute", "status", "cancel"]
        }
    
    async def handle_request(self, method: str, params: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Bridge between AI and external tools"""
        if method == "execute":
            # Delegative: run external tool
            process = await self.tool.run(params["command"], params["args"])
            # Track in MRH
            self.mrh.add_relevance(
                target=f"lct:execution_{process.id}",
                probability=1.0,
                relation="mrh:produces"
            )
            return {"status": "running", "pid": process.id}
```

### 4.3 Knowledge MCP Server

```python
class KnowledgeMCPServer(MCPEntity):
    """MCP server delegating to knowledge bases"""
    
    def __init__(self, kb_endpoint: str):
        super().__init__(entity_type="mcp_server", subtype="knowledge")
        self.knowledge_base = KnowledgeBaseClient(kb_endpoint)
        self.capabilities = {
            "responsive": True,  # Returns knowledge
            "delegative": True,  # Delegates to KB system
            "methods": ["search", "retrieve", "update_graph"]
        }
    
    async def handle_request(self, method: str, params: Dict) -> Dict:
        """Semantic bridge to knowledge systems"""
        if method == "search":
            # Delegative: query knowledge base
            results = await self.knowledge_base.semantic_search(
                query=params["query"],
                limit=params.get("limit", 10)
            )
            # Update MRH with discovered contexts
            for result in results:
                self.mrh.add_relevance(
                    target=result.lct_id,
                    probability=result.relevance_score,
                    relation="mrh:references"
                )
            return {"status": "success", "results": results}
```

## 5. Trust and Reputation for MCP Servers

### 5.1 Trust Metrics

MCP servers track trust across multiple dimensions:

1. **Response Trust**: Accuracy and completeness of responses
2. **Delegation Trust**: Reliability of backend delegation
3. **Latency Trust**: Consistency of response times
4. **Security Trust**: Proper authentication and authorization

### 5.2 Trust Computation

```python
def compute_mcp_trust(server: MCPServer) -> float:
    """Compute overall trust score for MCP server"""
    
    # Base trust from successful operations
    success_rate = server.successful_ops / server.total_ops
    
    # Delegation-specific trust
    delegation_reliability = server.successful_delegations / server.total_delegations
    
    # Latency consistency (lower variance = higher trust)
    latency_trust = 1.0 / (1.0 + server.latency_variance)
    
    # Security trust (failed auth attempts reduce trust)
    security_trust = 1.0 - (server.failed_auth / server.total_auth)
    
    # Weighted combination
    trust = (
        0.3 * success_rate +
        0.3 * delegation_reliability +
        0.2 * latency_trust +
        0.2 * security_trust
    )
    
    return trust
```

## 6. MCP Servers in SAGE Architecture

### 6.1 Integration with H-Level and L-Level

MCP servers integrate with SAGE's dual architecture:

#### H-Level (Strategic) Interaction
- H-level determines which MCP servers to use
- Evaluates trust scores for server selection
- Plans multi-server workflows
- Monitors overall delegation success

#### L-Level (Tactical) Interaction
- L-level executes specific MCP requests
- Handles low-level protocol details
- Manages connection pooling
- Implements retry logic

### 6.2 Example SAGE-MCP Workflow

```python
class SAGEWithMCP:
    """SAGE system with MCP server integration"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.h_level = HLevelReasoner()
        self.l_level = LLevelExecutor()
        self.mcp_registry = MCPRegistry()
    
    async def process_task(self, task: str):
        # H-level: Determine required MCP servers
        required_servers = self.h_level.identify_resources(task)
        
        # Select servers based on trust
        selected_servers = []
        for requirement in required_servers:
            candidates = self.mcp_registry.find_servers(requirement)
            best_server = max(candidates, key=lambda s: s.trust_score)
            selected_servers.append(best_server)
        
        # Create execution plan
        plan = self.h_level.create_plan(task, selected_servers)
        
        # L-level: Execute plan using MCP servers
        results = []
        for step in plan:
            if step.requires_mcp:
                # Delegate to MCP server
                result = await self.l_level.call_mcp(
                    server=step.mcp_server,
                    method=step.method,
                    params=step.params
                )
                # Update server trust based on result
                step.mcp_server.update_trust(result.success)
            else:
                # Direct execution
                result = await self.l_level.execute(step)
            
            results.append(result)
        
        return results
```

## 7. MCP Protocol Extensions for Web4

### 7.1 Web4-Specific Fields

MCP messages in Web4 include additional fields:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "query",
  "params": {
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true"
  },

  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "data": [...],
    "trust_attestation": {
      "server_lct": "mcp:database_server_001",
