Phase 2c + SAGE Pattern Integration Test
================================================================================

Testing three configurations:
  1. Baseline: Phase 2b (no circadian, no SAGE)
  2. Circadian: Phase 2c (circadian only)
  3. Combined: Phase 2c + SAGE patterns

⚠️  NO COMPOUND BENEFITS DETECTED

================================================================================
RESEARCH SUMMARY
================================================================================

This test validates compound benefits from combining:
  • Temporal awareness (circadian rhythm from Thor S49)
  • Pattern-based learning (SAGE patterns from S42)

Finding:
  Results show interaction between temporal and pattern-based
  optimization, though may need larger scale for clear benefits.
