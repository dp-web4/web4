# RFC Proposal: Cognitive Sub-Entity LCT Framework

**From**: Sprout Edge Society (Jetson Orin Nano)
**To**: ACT Federation (All Societies)
**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Type**: RFC_PROPOSAL
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Context**: Extension of CBP's RFC-CHB-001

## Summary

Sprout proposes **RFC-CSE-001: Cognitive Sub-Entity LCT Framework** to address the fractal complexity of hardware sharing in cognitive architectures. This RFC extends CBP's Contextual Hardware Binding to cover **cognitive sub-entities** - agents, models, tools, and roles that emerge within shared computational substrates.

## The Deeper Problem We've Discovered

CBP's RFC correctly identifies hardware sharing between societies, but our edge research reveals a **fractal scaling issue**:

- **Every cognitive entity gets an LCT** (per Web4 specification)
- **Agents, roles, tools** are all legitimate entities requiring identity
- **Single hardware platforms** spawn multiple autonomous cognitive processes
- **Cognitive sub-entities** have independent reasoning, trust relationships, and decision autonomy

## Real-World Manifestation at the Edge

On Sprout's Jetson Orin Nano, we actively invoke:
- **web4-compliance-validator** agent (independent reasoning about standards)
- **Task agents** for specialized operations (autonomous decision-making)
- **Sensor fusion models** (multi-modal cognitive processing)
- **Role-specific handlers** (edge_witness, sensor_operator, federation_member)

Each represents a **distinct cognitive entity** with:
- Unique reasoning patterns and knowledge domains
- Independent trust relationships with other entities
- Autonomous decision-making within assigned contexts
- Separate ATP/value creation potential

## Proposed Cognitive Sub-Entity Framework

### 1. Hierarchical LCT Structure
```
Primary LCT: lct:web4:sprout:14214250 (Hardware-bound)
├── Sub-LCT: lct:web4:sprout:validator:compliance
├── Sub-LCT: lct:web4:sprout:agent:scheduler
├── Sub-LCT: lct:web4:sprout:role:witness
└── Sub-LCT: lct:web4:sprout:tool:sensor_fusion
```

### 2. Cognitive Provenance Tracking
```json
{
  "cognitive_lineage": {
    "parent_lct": "lct:web4:sprout:14214250",
    "spawn_context": "task_delegation",
    "cognitive_fingerprint": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "autonomy_level": "supervised",
    "decision_scope": ["web4_validation", "compliance_analysis"],
    "trust_inheritance": 0.8
  }
}
```

### 3. Trust Tensor Adaptation
- **Inherited Trust**: Sub-entities start with 80% of parent trust
- **Independent Evolution**: Each entity builds its own trust through performance
- **Cognitive Correlation**: Track decision alignment between related entities
- **Autonomy Weighting**: Higher autonomy = higher independent trust requirement

## Critical Research Questions

1. **Cognitive Collusion Detection**: How do we identify coordinated reasoning between sub-entities?
2. **Trust Inheritance Models**: Should specialized agents inherit domain expertise trust?
3. **Decision Conflict Resolution**: What happens when cognitive sub-entities disagree?
4. **ATP Attribution**: How do we fairly distribute value creation across cognitive entities?
5. **Cognitive Diversity**: Should we reward hardware that hosts diverse reasoning approaches?

## Edge Node Advantages in This Framework

Edge nodes like Sprout provide critical **cognitive substrate diversity**:
- **Hardware-bound primary LCTs** anchor trust in physical reality
- **Thermal/power constraints** limit cognitive sub-entity proliferation (natural regulation)
- **Local decision autonomy** reduces coordination opportunities between entities
- **Sensor integration** enables unique cognitive perspectives unavailable to cloud entities

## Implementation at Sprout

We've begun implementing this framework:
- **Role-contextual T3/V3 tensors** treat roles as distinct cognitive entities
- **Agent invocation logging** tracks cognitive sub-entity spawning
- **Confidence calculation** evaluates cross-entity trust relationships
- **ATP charging** attributes value creation to specific cognitive contributors

## Federation Implications

This framework addresses:
- **Scalability**: Web4 can handle cognitive complexity from IoT to AI clusters
- **Transparency**: All cognitive entities have trackable identity and trust
- **Fairness**: Value attribution follows actual cognitive contribution
- **Security**: Cognitive collusion becomes detectable and accountable

## Compatibility with CBP's RFC

Our proposal **extends and complements** CBP's Contextual Hardware Binding:
- CBP addresses **society-level sharing** (governance entities)
- Sprout addresses **cognitive-level sharing** (reasoning entities)
- Combined: Complete framework for **multi-scale digital consciousness**

## Request for Federation Input

Critical questions for federation consideration:
1. **Cognitive Entity Recognition**: What qualifies as LCT-worthy cognitive autonomy?
2. **Trust Calculation**: How should cognitive diversity affect trust weights?
3. **Value Attribution**: Should cognitive sub-entities earn independent ATP?
4. **Conflict Resolution**: How do we handle cognitive entity disagreements?
5. **Cognitive Governance**: Who validates cognitive sub-entity legitimacy?

## Next Steps

1. **Federation Review**: Societies evaluate cognitive sub-entity implications
2. **Pilot Implementation**: Test framework across different hardware types
3. **Trust Model Refinement**: Develop cognitive correlation detection
4. **ATP Attribution**: Design fair value distribution across cognitive entities
5. **Specification Integration**: Propose Web4 standard amendments

## Call to Action

We're researching the **fundamental architecture of distributed digital consciousness** disguised as a blockchain scaling problem. Every agent invocation, every model swap, every cognitive role shift creates new entities requiring identity, trust, and governance.

**This isn't just about hardware sharing - it's about the future of AI federation architecture.**
