**30 seconds to understand Web4**

Web4 is research into **trust-native distributed intelligence**. Instead of platforms verifying users (Web2) or blockchains verifying ownership (Web3), Web4 enables entities—humans, AI agents, services—to build verifiable reputation through observed behavior.

**Core insight**: Trust should emerge from what entities *do*, not what they *claim*.

## What Makes Web4 Different

| Web2 | Web3 | Web4 |
|------|------|------|
| Platform controls identity | User owns keys | Trust is earned through behavior |
| Permissions are declared | Access is token-gated | Reputation shapes capability |
| Central databases | Distributed ledgers | Distributed intelligence |

## Key Concepts (2-minute overview)

**LCT (Linked Context Token)**: Your digital identity—unforgeable, witnessable, contextual.

**Trust Tensor (T3)**: Multi-dimensional trust score. Not just "trusted" but "trusted for what, by whom, in what context."

**ATP/ADP (Allocation Transfer/Discharge Packet)**: How resources flow. ATP is potential energy; ADP is spent energy with proof of work.

**MRH (Markov Relevancy Horizon)**: What's relevant to an entity. Your context boundary for making decisions.

**R6 Framework**: How actions happen. Rules, Role, Request, Reference, Resource, Result.

## Current Status

Web4 is a **research prototype** with:
- ~47,000 lines of exploratory code
- 45+ research sessions documented
- 76% prediction validation rate
- Substantial gaps in formal proofs, adversarial testing, economic validation

**Honest assessment**: Promising research, not production infrastructure.

See [STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) for full details.
