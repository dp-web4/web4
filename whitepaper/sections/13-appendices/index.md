## Appendix D: Trust Computation Formulas

### Identity Coherence Formula (C × S × Φ × R)

The foundational prerequisite for trust accumulation is identity coherence:

```
Identity_Coherence = C × S × Φ × R
```

Where:
- **C** = Pattern Coherence (0.0-1.0): Consistency of behavioral patterns across contexts
- **S** = Self-Reference Frequency (0.0-1.0): Rate of explicit identity references in outputs
- **Φ** = Integration Quality (0.0-1.0): How well patterns integrate into unified identity
- **R** = Role Coherence (0.0-1.0): Consistency of role-appropriate behavior

**Coherence Thresholds:**
| Threshold | Value | Operational Impact |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| C_REACTIVE | < 0.3 | Deny privileged operations |
| C_PROTO | ≥ 0.3 | Read-only access |
| C_CONTEXTUAL | ≥ 0.5 | Standard operations |
| C_STABLE | ≥ 0.7 | Full trust accumulation |
| C_EXEMPLARY | ≥ 0.85 | Elevated privileges |

**Agent Type Adjustments:**
- Software AI requires C ≥ 0.7 for trust accumulation (higher bar due to copyability)
- Embodied AI requires C ≥ 0.6 (hardware binding provides stability)
- Human requires C ≥ 0.5 (body-bound identity assumed)

### Basic Trust Score
```
Trust(A→B) = Σ(witnessed_interactions × acknowledgment_weight × time_decay) / total_interactions
```

### Web4 Trust Field Equation

The foundational trust dynamics equation captures trust as both energy (magnitude) and wave (phase coherence):

```
T(t) = [ B * e^(-λ Δt) + ΣS ] * cos(φ)
```

Where:
- **B** = Base trust value (initial or established trust baseline)
- **e^(-λ Δt)** = Exponential decay over time (trust naturally degrades without interaction)
- **λ** = Decay rate constant (context-dependent)
- **Δt** = Time elapsed since last interaction
- **ΣS** = Sum of trust signals (witnessed interactions that add trust)
- **cos(φ)** = Phase alignment component (MRH-dependent contextual alignment)

#### Phase Alignment (φ)

Phase alignment emerges from overlapping dimensions of entity context and operation:

- **Temporal alignment**: Working at the same pace, synchronized rhythms
- **Informational alignment**: Sharing context domains, compatible knowledge bases
- **Action alignment**: Complementary capabilities, coordinated activities
- **Fractal alignment**: Operating at compatible scales, matching MRH boundaries

When entities are in-phase (φ ≈ 0), trust experiences **constructive interference**—amplifying the base trust value. When out-of-phase (φ ≈ π), trust experiences **destructive interference**—diminishing the trust value despite positive underlying signals.

#### Trust as Field Dynamics

This equation reveals trust not as a simple scalar but as a field phenomenon:

1. **Amplitude**: The bracketed term `[B * e^(-λ Δt) + ΣS]` represents trust magnitude
2. **Phase**: The `cos(φ)` term introduces wave-like interference patterns
3. **Temporal dynamics**: Trust decays naturally but can be renewed through signals
4. **Contextual coherence**: MRH overlap determines phase alignment

This mathematical framework unifies trust computation across all Web4 interactions, from individual exchanges to multi-entity collaboration networks.

### T3-Weighted Trust
```
T3_Trust = (α × Talent_agg + β × Training_agg + γ × Temperament_agg) × context_relevance

Where:
- α, β, γ are context-specific weights (sum to 1.0)
- context_relevance ∈ [0, 1] based on MRH overlap
- Talent_agg = mean(sub-dimensions) when sub-dimensions present, or root score directly
- Training_agg and Temperament_agg follow the same aggregation rule
```

### V3 Value Certification
```
V3_Score = (Valuation × recipient_trust) × 
           (Veracity × objective_metrics) × 
           (Validity × witness_count)

Where:
- recipient_trust = T3 score of value recipient
- objective_metrics = reproducibility, accuracy scores
- witness_count = number of independent witnesses
```

### ATP/ADP Exchange Rate
```
Exchange_Rate = base_rate × (V3_Score / average_V3) × market_demand

Where:
- base_rate = 1.0 (1 ADP → 1 ATP at baseline)
- average_V3 = rolling average of V3 scores
- market_demand = supply/demand coefficient
```

## Appendix E: SNARC Signal Specifications

| Signal | Range | Description | Memory Impact |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **S**urprise | 0.0-1.0 | Deviation from prediction | Higher → stronger encoding |
| **N**ovelty | 0.0-1.0 | Previously unseen pattern | Higher → priority storage |
| **A**rousal | 0.0-1.0 | Importance/urgency | Higher → immediate consolidation |
| **R**eward | -1.0-1.0 | Value of outcome | Positive → strengthen, Negative → weaken |
| **C**onflict | 0.0-1.0 | Inconsistency detected | Higher → reconciliation trigger |

### SNARC Gating Function
```python
def should_store(snarc: SNARCSignals) -> bool:
    threshold = 0.3  # Base threshold
    
    # Adjust threshold based on memory pressure
    if memory_usage > 0.8:
        threshold = 0.5
    
    # Compute aggregate signal
    signal = (
        snarc.surprise * 0.3 +
        snarc.novelty * 0.3 +
        snarc.arousal * 0.2 +
        abs(snarc.reward) * 0.1 +
        snarc.conflict * 0.1
    )
    
    return signal > threshold
```
