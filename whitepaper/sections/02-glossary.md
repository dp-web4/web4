# Glossary of WEB4 Terms

*The language of trust-native intelligence, organized from foundation to frontier.*

---

## Core Terms
*The fundamental building blocks of Web4—master these to understand everything else.*

### Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)
> *"Every entity is born with and dies with its LCT—the unforgeable footprint of digital presence."*

The reification of presence itself. LCTs are permanently and immutably bound to a single entity (human, AI, organization, role, task, or resource) and are non-transferable. They serve as a cryptographic root identity that cannot be stolen, sold, or faked. If the entity ceases to exist, its LCT is marked void or slashed. LCTs form malleable links to create trust webs, delegation chains, and historical records—the nervous system of Web4.

### Alignment Transfer Protocol (ATP/ADP)
> *"Energy is the blood of the system; value is its heartbeat."*

A biological metaphor made digital. ATP tokens exist in "charged" (potential energy) or "discharged" (ADP - expended energy) states, mirroring cellular energy cycles. Work consumes ATP creating ADP, which when certified as valuable by recipients, converts back to ATP. This creates an auditable trail where genuine contribution generates genuine value—not mining, not staking, but real work recognized.

### T3 Tensor (Trust Tensor)
> *"Trust emerges from capability demonstrated over time."*

A three-dimensional metric capturing an entity's capabilities:
- **Talent**: Inherent aptitude or originality
- **Training**: Acquired knowledge and skills
- **Temperament**: Behavioral characteristics and reliability

Context-dependent and dynamically updated through actual performance.

### V3 Tensor (Value Tensor)
> *"Value is not declared but demonstrated, not claimed but confirmed."*

A three-dimensional metric quantifying created value:
- **Valuation**: Subjective worth to the recipient
- **Veracity**: Objective accuracy and reproducibility
- **Validity**: Confirmation of actual value transfer

Together with T3, enables nuanced assessment beyond simple ratings.

### Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)
> *"The MRH is how an entity knows where it belongs in the universe of relevance."*

Each entity's contextual lens defining what is knowable, actionable, and relevant within their scope. Not a wall but a gradient—a fuzzy boundary ensuring entities engage where they're most effective. Dimensions include fractal scale, informational scope, geographic scope, action scope, and temporal scope.

### Entity
> *"Anything with presence can be an entity—anything that can leave a footprint."*

Broadly defined as anything that can be paired with an LCT. This revolutionary expansion includes humans, AIs, organizations, roles, tasks, data resources, even thoughts. Entities can be agentic (self-directed), responsive (reactive), or delegative (authorizing).

### WEB4
> *"From platform-controlled to token-speculated to trust-native."*

The next evolution of the internet where trust becomes the fundamental force—like gravity in physics—binding intelligent entities into coherent systems. Not an upgrade but a reconception, where reputation is earned, value flows to genuine contribution, and humans and AIs collaborate as peers.

## Extension Terms
*Advanced concepts that extend and enrich the core framework.*

### Memory as Temporal Sensor
> *"Memory doesn't store the past—it senses it."*

A paradigm shift from passive storage to active perception. Memory becomes one of three complementary sensors: physical (spatial/present), memory (temporal/past), and cognitive (possibilities/future). Together they create the complete reality field for intelligence.

### Lightchain
> *"Trust without global consensus: coherence without weight."*

A hierarchical witness-based verification system using fractal protocols. Child entities create witness marks, parents acknowledge, creating bidirectional proof without global consensus. Scales from nanosecond operations to permanent anchors.

### Blockchain Typology
> *"Time itself becomes the organizing principle."*

Four-tier temporal hierarchy:
- **Compost Chains** (ms-sec): Ephemeral working memory
- **Leaf Chains** (sec-min): Short-term episodic memory
- **Stem Chains** (min-hr): Consolidated patterns
- **Root Chains** (permanent): Crystallized wisdom

### Role (as Entity)
> *"Roles themselves become intelligent actors with memory and reputation."*

Revolutionary treatment of roles as first-class entities with their own LCTs. Roles accumulate history of who filled them and how well, becoming wiser over time at selecting suitable performers.

### Witness-Acknowledgment Protocol
> *"Trust emerges from witnessed interactions, not global consensus."*

The lightweight verification backbone of Web4. Child entities send minimal witness marks upward, parents acknowledge, creating bidirectional proof without expensive consensus.

## Research Extensions
*Emerging concepts under active exploration—the frontier of Web4.*

### Synchronism
The philosophical framework underlying Web4—recognizing coherence, resonance, and shared intent as fundamental organizing principles. See [https://dpcars.net/synchronism](https://dpcars.net/synchronism) for deeper exploration.

### Fractal Organization
The principle that patterns repeat at every scale—from individual memories to global trust networks. What works at cell level scales to planetary level through the same fundamental mechanisms.

### Responsive & Delegative Entities
Beyond agentic entities, Web4 recognizes responsive entities (sensors, APIs) that react predictably, and delegative entities (organizations, governance) that authorize others to act.

## Deprecated Terms

### Linked Control Tokens
Original name for LCTs—evolved to "Context" to better capture their role in establishing operational context rather than control.

*This glossary evolves with Web4 itself. Core terms are stable foundations. Extensions are active frontiers. Research areas are tomorrow's cores.*
