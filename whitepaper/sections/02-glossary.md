# Glossary of WEB4 Terms

This glossary defines key terms and concepts related to WEB4 as presented in the provided documents.

## W

**WEB4:** A proposed next stage of the internet, shifting from centralized control (Web2) and token-driven decentralization (Web3) to a trust-driven, decentralized intelligence model. It aims to redefine trust, value, and collaboration in an AI-driven, potentially post-scarcity world. Key components include Linked Context Tokens (LCTs), Alignment Transfer Protocol (ATP), and T3/V3 Tensors.

## L

**Linked Control Tokens (LCTs):** Initially defined as decentralized trust chains that verify reputation, intent, and coherence across entities, replacing fragile credentials with cryptographically enforceable trust.

**Linked Context Tokens (LCTs):** An evolution of "Linked Control Tokens." LCTs are permanently and immutably bound to a single entity (which can be a task, data resource, AI, human, organization, or role) and are non-transferable. They serve as a cryptographic root identity for that entity within a specific context. If the entity ceases to exist, its LCT is marked void or slashed. LCTs can have malleable links to other LCTs to form trust webs, delegation chains, or historical logs. They are fundamental to establishing identity, context, trust, and provenance within the WEB4 framework.

**Lightchain:** A lightweight blockchain alternative that provides cryptographic verification without full blockchain overhead. Uses fractal witness-acknowledgment protocols for hierarchical trust without global consensus.

## A

**Alignment Transfer Protocol (ATP):** A mechanism for tracking energy and value flow within the WEB4 ecosystem. ATP tokens are envisioned as semi-fungible digital assets that can exist in a "charged" (ATP) or "discharged" (ADP) state, mirroring biological ATP/ADP cycles. Energy expenditure leads to a token becoming discharged, and value creation (certified by recipients) allows a discharged token to be exchanged for one or more charged tokens. This creates an auditable trail of energy flow and value generation, incentivizing meaningful contributions.

**ADP (Alignment Discharged Potential):** The "discharged" state of an ATP token. An ATP token transitions to ADP after its associated energy/resources are utilized. A discharged ADP token can be certified by value recipients and then exchanged for new, charged ATP tokens, with the exchange rate potentially varying based on the certified value of the work done.

**Agentic Entity:** An entity capable of initiating action based on its own decision-making processes. Examples include humans and sufficiently autonomous AI systems.

## T

**T3 Tensor (Trust Tensor):** A context-enabled multi-dimensional metric designed to quantify an entity's capability profile in terms of **T**alent, **T**raining, and **T**emperament. It is used to assess the trustworthiness and suitability of an entity for a particular role or task.

*   **Talent:** An entity's inherent aptitude or originality.
*   **Training:** An entity's acquired knowledge, skills, and experience relevant to a context.
*   **Temperament:** An entity's behavioral characteristics, adaptability, and coherence in interactions, often context-dependent (e.g., influenced by system prompts for AI).

**Temporal Sensor:** A reconceptualization of memory as an active sensor that perceives past temporal patterns, complementing physical sensors (spatial perception) and cognitive sensors (future projection).

## V

**V3 Tensor (Value Tensor):** A context-enabled multi-dimensional metric designed to quantify the value created by an entity. It incorporates sub-tensors for **V**aluation, **V**eracity, and **V**alidity.

*   **Valuation:** The subjective assessment of worth or utility by the recipient of the value.
*   **Veracity:** An objective assessment of the nature and claims of the value created (e.g., reproducibility, alignment with standards).
*   **Validity:** Confirmation that the value was actually transferred and received, often tied to the T3 score (credibility) of the recipient or validator.

**Value Confirmation Mechanism (VCM):** The process by which discharged ADP tokens are certified for the value they represent. This often involves multi-recipient attestation to ensure decentralized consensus around value creation. Validators might use their LCTs and T3/V3 scores in this process.

## E

**Entity (in WEB4 context):** Broadly defined as anything that can be paired with a Linked Context Token (LCT). This includes tasks, data resources, AI agents, humans, organizations, and roles. Entities can be classified as agentic, responsive, or delegative.

**Entity Memory:** A specialized memory type that tracks WHO to trust based on historical interactions, maintaining T3/V3 scores over time.

## R

**Responsive Entity:** An entity that produces a single output for a single input, reacting deterministically or probabilistically without self-initiated actions. Examples include sensors, APIs, or pre-programmed functions.

**Role (as an Entity):** A job description or function within the WEB4 ecosystem that is treated as an entity with its own LCT. A Role LCT can define its system prompt (purpose), permissions (linked to authority LCTs), required domain knowledge (linked to informational LCTs), scope of action, and a history of agent entities that have performed the role, along with their reputational scores (V3 validated T3).

## D

**Delegative Entity:** An entity that does not act directly but can authorize other (typically agentic) entities to act on its behalf. It carries authority, rights, or responsibility. Examples include organizations or governance mechanisms.

**Dictionary Entity:** Trust-bounded translator entities that bridge between different domains or modalities (e.g., ASR, TTS, tokenizers, cross-model bridges).

## M

**Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH):** A tensor representing an entity's contextual zone of influence, comprehension, and authorization. It defines what is currently relevant and locally operative to that entity. Dimensions include Fractal Scale, Informational Scope, Geographic Scope, Action Scope, and Temporal Scope. The MRH can be cached within an LCT for efficient querying, though it can also be computed from T3/V3 scores and LCT links.

*   **Fractal Scale (MRH Dimension):** The hierarchical level at which an entity primarily exists or acts (e.g., quantum, molecular, biospheric, planetary, galactic).
*   **Informational Scope (MRH Dimension):** The types of information most relevant or accessible to the entity (e.g., legal, biophysical, technical, ethical, strategic).
*   **Geographic Scope (MRH Dimension):** The physical or virtual location relevance for an entity (e.g., local, regional, global, specific virtual zones).
*   **Action Scope (MRH Dimension):** The classes of action an entity is capable of or authorized to perform (e.g., authoring, signing, delegating, reacting, observing).
*   **Temporal Scope (MRH Dimension):** The time horizon within which an entity tends to operate or predict (e.g., milliseconds, hours, decades).

**Memory Sensor:** Memory reconceptualized as an active temporal sensor that perceives past patterns, maintains witness marks, and provides contextualized recall.

## S

**Synchronism:** A broader philosophical or systemic framework referenced in the chats, emphasizing coherence, intent flow, and emergent properties. WEB4 concepts like LCTs, ATP, and fractal ethics are often discussed in relation to Synchronism's principles.

**Sidecar Memory:** A memory type that stores WHAT was experienced and learned, with SNARC-gated selective retention.

**SNARC Signals:** Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict - affective signals that gate memory formation and retention.

## B

**Blockchain Typology:** A four-tier temporal hierarchy in Web4:
- **Compost Chains:** Ephemeral working memory (milliseconds to seconds)
- **Leaf Chains:** Short-term episodic memory (seconds to minutes)  
- **Stem Chains:** Medium-term consolidated memory (minutes to hours)
- **Root Chains:** Long-term crystallized wisdom (permanent)

## W (Additional)

**Witness Mark:** Minimal cryptographic proof sent upward in fractal hierarchy to verify events without transmitting full data.

**Witness Acknowledgment:** Parent's confirmation of receiving a witness mark, creating bidirectional proof of event occurrence.
