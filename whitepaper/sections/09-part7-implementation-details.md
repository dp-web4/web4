# Part 7: Implementation Details

## 7.1. Core Implementation Mechanisms

### 7.1.1. Witness Mark & Acknowledgment Protocol

The witness-acknowledgment protocol provides lightweight verification without global consensus:

```python
class WitnessMark:
    """Minimal cryptographic proof (200-500 bytes)"""
    def __init__(self, event_hash, creator_lct, timestamp, signature):
        self.event_hash = event_hash
        self.creator_lct = creator_lct
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.signature = signature
        self.size = len(self.serialize())  # Typically 200-500 bytes
    
    def send_upward(self, parent_entity):
        """Send witness mark to parent in hierarchy"""
        parent_entity.receive_witness(self)

class Acknowledgment:
    """Parent's confirmation of witness receipt"""
    def __init__(self, witness_mark, acknowledger_lct, trust_adjustment):
        self.witness_hash = hash(witness_mark)
        self.acknowledger_lct = acknowledger_lct
        self.trust_adjustment = trust_adjustment
        self.timestamp = now()
```

This simple handshake replaces complex consensus mechanisms while maintaining verifiability.

### 7.1.2. Value Confirmation Mechanism (VCM)

The VCM certifies discharged ADP tokens through multi-recipient attestation:

```python
class ValueConfirmationMechanism:
    def certify_value(self, adp_token, recipients):
        """Recipients attest to value received"""
        attestations = []
        
        for recipient in recipients:
            # Each recipient evaluates V3 components
            v3_assessment = recipient.assess_value({
                "valuation": self.assess_subjective_worth(adp_token),
                "veracity": self.verify_objective_claims(adp_token),
                "validity": self.confirm_receipt(adp_token)
            })
            
            # Weight by recipient's T3 credibility
            weight = recipient.t3_score * recipient.domain_expertise
            attestations.append((v3_assessment, weight))
        
        # Calculate certified value
        certified_value = self.aggregate_attestations(attestations)
        
        # Determine ATP exchange rate
        exchange_rate = self.calculate_exchange_rate(certified_value)
        
        return exchange_rate
```

### 7.1.3. SNARC Signal Processing

Affective signals gate memory formation and attention:

```python
class SNARCProcessor:
    """Surprise, Novelty, Arousal, Reward, Conflict signals"""
    
    def evaluate_event(self, event, context):
        signals = {
            "surprise": self.calculate_surprise(event, context.expectations),
            "novelty": self.assess_novelty(event, context.history),
            "arousal": self.measure_arousal(event.importance),
            "reward": self.evaluate_reward(event.outcome),
            "conflict": self.detect_conflict(event, context.beliefs)
        }
        
        # High signals trigger stronger memory encoding
        encoding_strength = self.calculate_encoding_strength(signals)
        
        # Conflict triggers reconciliation
        if signals["conflict"] > 0.7:
            self.trigger_reconciliation(event, context)
        
        return signals, encoding_strength
```

### 7.1.4. Dual Memory Architecture

Separating entity relationships from experiential memory:

```python
class EntityMemory:
    """WHO to trust - relationship tracking"""
    def __init__(self, owner_lct):
        self.owner_lct = owner_lct
        self.trust_graph = {}  # LCT -> trust scores
        self.interaction_history = {}  # LCT -> interaction records
        self.retention_period = "long"  # Persists longer
    
    def update_trust(self, entity_lct, interaction_result):
        """Update trust based on interaction outcome"""
        current_trust = self.trust_graph.get(entity_lct, 0.5)
        trust_delta = self.calculate_trust_change(interaction_result)
        self.trust_graph[entity_lct] = bound(0, 1, current_trust + trust_delta)

class SidecarMemory:
    """WHAT was experienced - event storage"""
    def __init__(self, entity_memory):
        self.entity_memory = entity_memory
        self.events = []
        self.snarc_processor = SNARCProcessor()
        self.retention_policy = "snarc_gated"  # Based on signal strength
    
    def store_event(self, event):
        """Store event with SNARC-gated retention"""
        signals, strength = self.snarc_processor.evaluate_event(event, self)
        
        if strength > self.storage_threshold:
            event.encoding_strength = strength
            event.retention_until = self.calculate_retention(strength)
            self.events.append(event)
```

### 7.1.5. Dictionary Entities

Trust-bounded translators between domains:

```python
class DictionaryEntity:
    """Translators that carry trust scores"""
    def __init__(self, lct, source_domain, target_domain):
        self.lct = lct
        self.source_domain = source_domain
        self.target_domain = target_domain
        self.t3_scores = {"talent": 0.0, "training": 0.0, "temperament": 0.0}
        self.translation_history = []
    
    def translate(self, content, source_trust):
        """Translate with trust propagation"""
        translation = self.perform_translation(content)
        
        # Trust degrades based on translator's T3 scores
        output_trust = source_trust * self.get_trust_multiplier()
        
        # Record for reputation updates
        self.translation_history.append({
            "content": content,
            "translation": translation,
            "trust_preserved": output_trust / source_trust
        })
        
        return translation, output_trust
    
    def get_trust_multiplier(self):
        """Calculate how much trust is preserved in translation"""
        return (self.t3_scores["talent"] * 0.3 + 
                self.t3_scores["training"] * 0.5 + 
                self.t3_scores["temperament"] * 0.2)
```

## 7.2. Integration Examples

These mechanisms combine in practice:

```python
# Example: AI discovers insight, shares via witness marks
ai_researcher = Agent(lct="researcher-001")
insight = ai_researcher.discover("New optimization pattern")

# Create witness mark with SNARC signals
snarc_signals = SNARCProcessor().evaluate_event(insight, ai_researcher.context)
witness = WitnessMark(
    event_hash=hash(insight),
    creator_lct=ai_researcher.lct,
    timestamp=now(),
    signature=ai_researcher.sign(insight)
)

# Send to parent for acknowledgment
parent_lab = Entity(lct="lab-001")
ack = parent_lab.acknowledge(witness)

# Store in dual memory
ai_researcher.entity_memory.update_trust(parent_lab.lct, ack)
ai_researcher.sidecar_memory.store_event(insight)

# Value confirmation when applied
application_results = apply_insight(insight)
recipients = get_beneficiaries(application_results)
vcm = ValueConfirmationMechanism()
exchange_rate = vcm.certify_value(
    adp_token=ai_researcher.spent_atp,
    recipients=recipients
)

# Receive new ATP based on certified value
ai_researcher.receive_atp(exchange_rate * ai_researcher.spent_atp.amount)
```

## 7.3. Performance Characteristics

### Witness Marks
- Size: 200-500 bytes per mark
- Processing: O(1) for creation, O(1) for verification
- Network overhead: Minimal (single upward transmission)

### Value Confirmation
- Latency: Depends on recipient response time (typically seconds to minutes)
- Throughput: Scales with number of recipients
- Consensus: Not required (recipient attestation sufficient)

### Memory Operations
- Entity Memory: O(log n) lookup, persistent storage
- Sidecar Memory: O(1) append, SNARC-gated pruning
- Cross-reference: O(1) via LCT indexing

### Dictionary Translation
- Trust degradation: Multiplicative per hop
- Verification: Optional but recommended for critical paths
- Caching: Supported for repeated translations

These implementation details provide the technical foundation for Web4's trust-native architecture while maintaining efficiency and scalability.
