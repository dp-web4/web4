## Introduction

This document is intended as an accessible yet conceptually rigorous introduction to the WEB4 frameworkâ€”a paradigm that redefines trust, value, and intelligence in the age of autonomous collaboration. It is not a technical specification, nor a full implementation blueprint. Rather, it lays the conceptual foundation for a new kind of internet: one in which reputation is earned, identity is contextual, value is verifiable, and intelligenceâ€”human or artificialâ€”operates within a shared ethical substrate.

WEB4 introduces and interconnects several core mechanisms:
- **Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)**: Non-transferable, cryptographically anchored identity constructs for entities, roles, thoughts, and systems.
- **T3 and V3 Tensors**: Multidimensional trust and value representations.
- **Alignment Transfer Protocol (ATP)**: A semi-fungible energy-value exchange modeled on biological ATP/ADP cycles.
- **Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)**: A contextual tensor governing what is knowable, actionable, and relevant within each entity's scope.

The LCT framework is protected by two issued U.S. patentsâ€”[US11477027](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11477027B1) and [US12278913](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12278913B1)â€”with additional patents pending. These filings ensure the foundational mechanisms are recognized, while preserving the option for wide deployment and public benefit.

Funding for portions of this research and development has been provided by **MetaLINNX, Inc.**, which supports the evolution of decentralized, trust-based systems and the public infrastructure required to sustain them.

The authors intend to release substantial portions of this work, including simulation code, governance tools, and Web4-native protocols, under the **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)**. Our aim is to foster a living, collaborative, and ethically grounded ecosystemâ€”open to audit, extension, and shared stewardship.
