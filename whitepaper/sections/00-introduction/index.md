## Introduction

This document presents WEB4â€”a paradigm that redefines trust, value, and intelligence in the age of autonomous collaboration. Building upon the philosophical framework of [Synchronism](https://dpcars.net/synchronism), which recognizes coherence and resonance as fundamental organizing principles, WEB4 manifests these concepts as practical internet architecture.

The document follows a fractal structure: conceptual foundations that contain the whole vision, with links to technical implementations for those who wish to build. It is neither purely visionary nor purely technical, but bothâ€”reflecting our belief that profound change requires both imagination and engineering.

## Core Mechanisms

WEB4 introduces and interconnects several foundational components:

- **Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)**: The reification of presence itselfâ€”non-transferable, cryptographically anchored footprints that give every entity an unforgeable identity in the digital realm.

- **T3 and V3 Tensors**: Multidimensional trust and value representations that capture capability (Talent, Training, Temperament) and contribution (Valuation, Veracity, Validity).

- **Alignment Transfer Protocol (ATP)**: A semi-fungible energy-value exchange modeled on biological ATP/ADP cycles, where work creates value and value generates energy.

- **Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)**: A contextual boundary governing what is knowable, actionable, and relevant within each entity's scope.

- **Memory as Temporal Sensor**: A reconception of memory not as storage but as active perception of temporal patterns, building trust through witnessed experience.

## Philosophical Grounding

WEB4 emerges from [Synchronism](https://dpcars.net/synchronism)â€”the recognition that sustainable systems arise from coherence (internal consistency), resonance (harmonious interaction), and shared intent. While Synchronism provides the philosophical substrate, WEB4 transforms these principles into concrete protocols, measurable metrics, and implementable architectures.

Where specific Synchronism concepts add meaningful depthâ€”such as coherence ethics or fractal organizationâ€”we reference them directly. Otherwise, we focus on practical manifestation rather than philosophical abstraction.

## Legal and Organizational Framework

The LCT framework is protected by two issued U.S. patentsâ€”[US11477027](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11477027B1) and [US12278913](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12278913B1)â€”with additional patents pending. These filings ensure the foundational mechanisms are recognized, while preserving the option for wide deployment and public benefit.

Funding for portions of this research and development has been provided by **MetaLINNX, Inc.**, which supports the evolution of decentralized, trust-based systems and the public infrastructure required to sustain them.

The authors intend to release substantial portions of this work, including simulation code, governance tools, and Web4-native protocols, under the **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)**. Our aim is to foster a living, collaborative, and ethically grounded ecosystemâ€”open to audit, extension, and shared stewardship.
