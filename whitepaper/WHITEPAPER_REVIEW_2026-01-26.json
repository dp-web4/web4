  "summary": "Two new features implemented in web4-trust-core since last review: Creative Reasoning Detection module and Presence Tracking with silence-as-signal governance. Both represent significant governance enhancements that require whitepaper documentation. Hardware binding status should also be updated to reflect TPM 2.0 working implementation.",

      "description": "Add subsection documenting 'Silence as Signal' governance model. New PresenceTracker infrastructure (presence.py, 278 lines) enables absence detection and T3 integration via apply_silence_penalty(). This addresses governance resilience gap: systems that only react to explicit failures miss half the intelligence. Should be presented as an extension to governance-through-resonance concept—absence of expected activity is trust-relevant information.",

Uses 23 hedging markers (uncertainty acknowledgment) and 20 fabrication markers (false claims, S43/S44 patterns). Integrates with identity_integrity.py and R6 evaluation pipeline.
