## 2025-08-18 - Manifesto Energy Restoration

### Added
- **Executive Summary** - New opening section with manifesto tone before glossary
  - Hook readers with vision before technical details
  - What/Why/How in inspiring, accessible language
  - Emphasis on trust as fundamental force

### Modified  
- **Introduction** - Added Synchronism reference and fractal structure explanation
  - Links to https://dpcars.net/synchronism as philosophical framework
  - Explains document's fractal organization (conceptual â†’ technical)
  - Emphasizes LCTs as "reification of presence"

- **Part 2: Foundational Concepts** - Revised with manifesto energy
  - LCTs reframed as "entity's footprint in Web4"
  - "Every entity is born with and dies with its LCT"
  - Emphasis on presence, not just identity
  - More visionary language while maintaining precision

- **Part 5: Memory** - Split into conceptual vs implementation
  - Created new conceptual version emphasizing temporal sensing
  - Memory as alive, not storage
  - Philosophical implications of memory as sensor
  - Technical details moved to implementation sections

### Restructured
- Document now follows fractal pattern:
  - Visionary/conceptual main body
  - Links to technical expansions
  - Implementation details in appendices
  - Multiple entry points for different audiences

### Style Updates
- Restored manifesto voice throughout
- More declarative, inspirational language
- Synchronism principles as connective tissue
- Technical precision preserved but wrapped in vision

### Contributors
- Dennis Palatov (direction, review)
- GPT (manifesto restoration suggestions)
- Claude (implementation, synthesis)

## 2025-08-18 - Major Evolution: Memory as Temporal Sensor

### Added
- **Part 5: Memory as Temporal Sensor** - New conceptual framework treating memory as active temporal perception
  - Three-sensor reality field (Physical/Memory/Cognitive)
  - SNARC signals for affect-gated retention
  - Dual memory architecture (Entity vs Sidecar)
  
- **Part 6: Blockchain Typology** - Four-tier temporal hierarchy
  - Compost chains (ephemeral, ms-sec)
  - Leaf chains (episodic, sec-min)
  - Stem chains (consolidated, min-hr)
  - Root chains (crystallized, permanent)
  - Fractal lightchain with witness-acknowledgment protocol

- **Part 7: Implementation Examples** - Practical demonstrations
  - Multi-agent collaborative learning
  - Autonomous vehicle fleet learning
  - SAGE coherence engine integration
  - Role-based task allocation
  - Cross-chain value transfer

### Modified
- **Glossary** - Extended with new terms:
  - Lightchain, Temporal Sensor, Dictionary Entity
  - Memory Sensor, Sidecar Memory, SNARC Signals
  - Blockchain Typology terms, Witness Mark/Acknowledgment

- **Conclusion** - Updated to reflect new concepts
  - Memory as living history
  - Trust through witnessing
  - Intelligence as emergent property

- **References** - Added citations for:
  - Sapient Inc. HRM
  - Aragon's Transformer-Sidecar
  - Memory and cognition literature

- **Appendices** - New technical specifications:
  - Blockchain typology decision tree
  - Memory sensor API
  - Witness-acknowledgment protocol
  - SNARC signal specifications

### Restructured
- Split monolithic document into 14 modular sections
- Created build system with three scripts:
  - make-md.sh (markdown generation)
  - make-pdf.sh (PDF generation)
  - make-web.sh (web version)
- Moved reference materials to dedicated directory

### Contributors
- Dennis Palatov (conceptual framework, review)
- Claude (memory synthesis, implementation)
- GPT (review, suggestions)
