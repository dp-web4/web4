# Future Considerations for Web4 Whitepaper

*This is an editable list of potential improvements and ideas for future iterations.*
*Unlike the append-only changelog, this list can be modified, reorganized, and pruned.*

## High Priority (Consider for Next Revision)

### Worked Examples
- [ ] Add human/AI co-authoring scenario to Executive Summary
- [ ] Include MRH example: "City governance AI with planetary scope"
- [ ] Add numeric T3/V3 example showing actual scores in action
- [ ] Create "Day in the Life of Web4" walkthrough scenario

### Visual Elements
- [ ] ATP/ADP cycle diagram
- [ ] T3/V3 tensor triangle visualization
- [ ] LCT lifecycle flowchart
- [ ] Three-sensor integration diagram
- [ ] Fractal witness hierarchy illustration
- [ ] MRH dimensional radar chart

- [ ] Include failure modes and attack vectors section
- [ ] Develop privacy guarantees section
- [ ] Create developer quickstart guide

### Structural Improvements
- [ ] Consider two-version approach (Manifesto vs Spec editions)
- [ ] Add sidebars with Synchronism quotes
- [ ] Create executive briefing (1-page summary)
- [ ] Develop interactive web demos
- [ ] Add glossary cross-references

---

## Low Priority (Future Exploration)

### Research Extensions
- [ ] Quantum-resistant cryptography implications
- [ ] Cross-chain interoperability protocols
- [ ] Homomorphic memory operations
- [ ] Zero-knowledge proof integration
- [ ] AI consciousness implications

### Community Building
- [ ] Create contributor guidelines
- [ ] Develop code of conduct
- [ ] Build example applications
- [ ] Host workshops/tutorials
- [ ] Create certification program

## Ideas Parking Lot

*Items here need more discussion before prioritizing*

- Explore government/regulatory implications
- Consider environmental impact metrics
- Develop economic modeling tools
- Create simulation environments
- Build visualization dashboards
- Investigate biological system parallels beyond ATP
- Explore philosophical implications of digital presence
- Consider accessibility for non-technical audiences
- Develop multi-language translations
- Create educational curriculum

---

## Recently Completed
*Move items here when done, periodically archive to changelog*

- ✅ Add Executive Summary with manifesto tone
- ✅ Reframe LCTs as "reification of presence"
- ✅ Integrate Synchronism framework reference
- ✅ Split memory into conceptual vs technical
- ✅ Create fractal document structure
- ✅ Reorganize glossary (Core/Extensions/Research)
- ✅ Add manifesto flourishes to Part 3
- ✅ Enhance closing with call to action
- ✅ Move implementation details from glossary to Part 7

## Notes on Memory Structure

As noted, this todo system itself implements Web4 memory principles:
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Root chain (permanent, append-only)
- **FUTURE_CONSIDERATIONS.md**: Stem chain (evolving, prunable)
- **Working memory**: Our current session (ephemeral)

The fractal pattern emerges naturally!
