# Claude Context for Web4

## Machine Information
**Current Machine**: WSL2 on Windows
- **OS**: Linux 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2
- **Platform**: /mnt/c/exe/projects/ai-agents/web4
- **Working Directory**: /mnt/c/exe/projects/ai-agents/web4

## Authentication
**GitHub PAT Location**: `../.env` (GITHUB_PAT variable)
- Use for pushing: `git push https://dp-web4:$(grep GITHUB_PAT ../.env | cut -d= -f2)@github.com/dp-web4/web4.git`

## Project Overview

Web4 is a trust-native distributed intelligence architecture that implements:
- **Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)**: Unforgeable digital presence
- **Trust Tensors (T3)**: Multi-dimensional trust calculations
- **Dictionary Entities**: Living keepers of meaning across domains
- **Markov Relevancy Horizons (MRH)**: Context boundaries for entities
- **R6 Action Framework**: Intent to reality transformation

## Whitepaper Status

The Web4 whitepaper is actively evolving with:
- **Current Version**: Full technical document (~100+ pages)
- **Planned Split**: Manifesto (10-15 pages) + Technical expansions
- **Key Concepts Documented**:
  - Foundational concepts (LCTs, Entities, Roles, R6, MRH, Dictionaries, Trust as Gravity)
  - Value and trust mechanics (ATP/ADP tokens, T3 tensors)
  - Implementation details and examples
  - Governance and blockchain integration

## Recent Developments

### Dictionary Entities (August 20, 2025)
- Elevated from implementation detail to foundational concept
- Section 2.6 in Foundational Concepts
- Living entities with their own LCTs
- Manage trust degradation in translation
- Embody compression-trust relationship

### Trust as Gravity (August 20, 2025)
- Added Section 2.7 to Foundational Concepts
- Trust operates as fundamental force
- High-trust entities attract attention, resources, opportunities
- T3 tensor scores create actual force fields

### Navigation Architecture
- Expandable navigation with proper header IDs
- All seven foundational concepts accessible
- Web-first presentation optimized

## Build System

### Whitepaper Generation
```bash
cd whitepaper
./make-pdf.sh    # Generate PDF version
./make-web.sh    # Generate web version with navigation
./make.sh        # Build all formats
```

### Safety Features
- Pre-build conflict checking
- Automatic pull if safe
- Clear conflict resolution instructions
- Complete asset copying

## Key Insights

### Compression-Trust Unity
- Compression requires trust in shared decompression artifacts
- What appears "lossy" is missing context in receiver
- Dictionaries manage decompression/recompression across domains

### Trust Networks
- High trust = Maximum compression
- Medium trust = Moderate compression
- Low trust = Minimal compression
- Zero trust = Raw data transmission

## Development Philosophy

Web4 isn't just infrastructureâ€”it's the nervous system for a new kind of internet where trust emerges from the interplay of presence, capability, intent, and context.
