# Web4: Trust-Native Ontology for Distributed Intelligence

<!-- SUMMARIZER BLOCK: Consistent headers for AI-to-human relay -->
## Status Snapshot (2026-02-12)

### Highlights
- **Attack simulations**: 424 vectors across 84 tracks (~85% detection rate)
- **Formal threat model**: [THREAT_MODEL.md v2.0](docs/reference/security/THREAT_MODEL.md) - adversary model, trust boundaries, attack taxonomy
- **Coordination framework**: ~25,000 lines, Phase 2a-2d validated (76% prediction accuracy)
- **Cross-system integration**: SAGE ↔ Web4 pattern exchange operational
- **Nova external review**: Comprehensive responses documented

### Validations
- Attack simulation suite: 372 attack functions, all defended
- EP closed-loop simulation: 3+ lives with carry-forward state
- Federation patterns: 1000+ patterns validated on edge (Jetson)
- Trust tensor calculations: T3 composite scores stable

### Risks / Gaps
- **P0 Blocker**: Hardware binding spec complete - implementation progressing privately (contact dp@metalinxx.io)
- Economic validation: No real-world market testing
- Formal Sybil proofs: Empirical defenses, not mathematical proofs
- Production deployment: All testing is synthetic

### Open Questions
- Are stake amounts actually deterrent? (no economic modeling)
- Does witness diversity resist sophisticated cartels?
- What's the minimal viable Web4 for production pilot?

### Next
- Hardware binding implementation (TPM 2.0/Secure Enclave/WebAuthn) - in progress, not yet public
- Economic attack modeling with real parameters
- ACT ledger integration

> **Research prototype exploring trust, identity, and authorization for AI agents**

## 🎯 Vision

**Web4 formalizes trust as a first-class primitive for distributed AI collaboration and coordination—not merely data exchange.**

The internet evolved from documents (Web1) to applications (Web2) to ownership (Web3). Web4 proposes the next layer: **verifiable trust relationships** between humans, AI agents, and services that enable meaningful coordination without central control.

### About "Web4"

Like Web1, Web2, and Web3, "Web4" is a generational label describing capabilities needed for the agentic AI era—not a single protocol or product. Many projects are tackling various aspects of this challenge.

**This project suite** focuses specifically on **trust infrastructure** for agent-agent and agent-human interactions: how agents establish identity, build reputation, delegate authority, and coordinate safely across organizational boundaries.

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### The Problem

AI agents are increasingly autonomous—browsing, transacting, coordinating with other agents. Current architectures assume either:
- **Central control**: A platform decides who's trusted (doesn't scale, single point of failure)
- **Cryptographic ownership**: You're trusted if you hold the right keys (insufficient—holding a key doesn't mean you'll act well)

Neither addresses the core question: **How do I know this agent will behave appropriately in this context?**

### How Web4 Differs from Web3

| Aspect | Web3 | Web4 |
|--------|------|------|
| **Trust basis** | Cryptographic proof of ownership | Behavioral reputation over time |
| **Identity** | Wallet addresses | Linked Context Tokens (LCTs) with witnessed history |
| **Authorization** | Token-gated access | Context-dependent trust tensors |
| **Coordination** | Smart contracts | Federated societies with emergent trust structures |
| **Focus** | Asset ownership | Agent behavior and intent |

### What Problems This Could Address

- **AI Agent Accountability**: Every action traceable to an identity with reputation at stake
- **Cross-Platform Coordination**: Agents from different systems interoperating through shared trust protocols
- **Graduated Authorization**: Not just "allowed/denied" but nuanced trust based on context, history, and stakes
- **Self-Organizing Trust**: Societies that establish norms through interaction rather than requiring top-down rule enforcement

## 🏗️ Four Development Tracks

Web4 contains **four development tracks** at different maturity levels:

### Track 1: 4-Life Society Simulation (Now Standalone)

**What it is**: A fractal sandbox for simulating Web4 societies - agents form societies, societies join societies, trust emerges through interaction. Named "4-Life" for the emergent, self-organizing nature of the simulation (like Conway's Game of Life, but with trust dynamics).

**Status**: **Evolved to standalone project** → [github.com/dp-web4/4-life](https://github.com/dp-web4/4-life)

The original prototype (`/game/`) has been archived to `archive/game-prototype/` with documentation of its evolution. Active simulation research continues in `/simulations/` (attack simulations, trust dynamics) and the standalone 4-life repo.

**Documentation**:
- [`archive/game-prototype/ARCHIVED.md`](archive/game-prototype/ARCHIVED.md) - Evolution history
- [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) - Security research status
- [4-life repo](https://github.com/dp-web4/4-life) - Active development

**Use for**: Historical reference; for active game development see 4-life repo

### Track 2: `web4-standard/implementation/authorization/` - PostgreSQL Authorization Layer

**What it is**: Database-backed authorization with security mitigations.

**Status**: More mature, but still research
- Real SQL schemas with constraints

- `test_security_attacks.py`, `test_atp_refund_exploit.py`

**Use for**: Authorization logic that needs persistence and real constraints

### Track 3: `demo/` - Commerce Demo (Narrow Application)

**What it is**: A working demo showing one use case (AI agent purchasing).

**Status**: Functional demo, not production deployment

## What Is Web4?

Web4 is a **research ontology** — a formal structure of typed relationships through which trust, identity, and value are expressed.

```
Web4 = MCP + RDF + LCT + T3/V3*MRH + ATP/ADP
```

Where: `/` = "verified by", `*` = "contextualized by", `+` = "augmented with"

**Core equation components:**
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) — I/O membrane for inter-entity communication
- **RDF** (Resource Description Framework) — Ontological backbone; all trust relationships are typed triples, all MRH graphs are RDF, all semantic queries use SPARQL
- **LCT** (Linked Context Token) — Verifiable presence anchored to hardware
- **T3/V3** (Trust/Value Tensors) — Multi-dimensional trust (Talent/Training/Temperament) and value (Valuation/Veracity/Validity), bound to entity-role pairs via RDF
- **MRH** (Markov Relevancy Horizon) — Fractal context scoping, implemented as RDF graphs
- **ATP/ADP** (Allocation Transfer/Discharge Packets) — Bio-inspired energy metabolism

**Built on this foundation:** Societies, SAL (governance), AGY (delegation), ACP (autonomous operation), Dictionaries (semantic bridges), R6/R7 (action framework), Federation (multi-society coordination)

### The Research Questions

- How do you give AI agents authority without losing control?
- How does trust emerge and decay in distributed systems?
- How do you coordinate multiple AI societies?
- What security properties are achievable at scale?

### What We're Exploring

**Fine-grained delegation** with enforcement:

```
Example: Agent purchasing with constraints
- Daily budget limits
- Per-transaction limits
- Resource type restrictions
- Approval thresholds
- Instant revocation
```
