# WEB4: The Trust-Native Internet

> *Where trust is earned, not granted. Where value flows to genuine contribution. Where humans and artificial intelligences collaborate as peers.*

## 🚀 Web4 Standard - Living Document Co-Evolving with Implementations

**The Web4 Internet Standard is a living proposal that evolves through dialogue with implementations.** Created through unprecedented collaboration between AI systems (Manus, Nova, Claude) and human architects, the standard demonstrates Web4's core principle: witnessed presence strengthening truth.

### Bidirectional Alignment Philosophy
Web4 is not a fixed specification for compliance but a pattern language that co-evolves with its implementations:
- **Standard → Implementation**: Patterns guide experiments
- **Implementation → Standard**: Discoveries inform evolution
- Each implementation teaches us what naturally emerges
- Alignment, not compliance, is the organizing principle

### Current Status (January 2025)
- ✅ **Living Standard** evolving with implementations
- ✅ Complete nine-component architecture (LCTs + MRH + Trust + MCP + SAL + AGY + ACP + ATP + Dictionaries)
- ✅ Reference implementations in Python with test coverage
- ✅ ACT blockchain demonstrating 95% alignment
- ✅ Comprehensive witness specification (JOSE/COSE formats)
- ✅ MRH as RDF graphs with SPARQL queries and trust propagation
- ✅ Full governance framework with societies, laws, and authority delegation
- ✅ Autonomous agent operation with human oversight
- ✅ Energy-based economy with readiness costs discovered (~33% overhead)
- ✅ Semantic interoperability through living dictionary entities

### Recent Discoveries from Implementations
- **Roles as Attention Partitions**: Not power structures (ACT, Jan 2025)
- **Readiness Economy**: ~33% resources for "idle" readiness (ACT, Jan 2025)
- **Synthon Consciousness**: Human-AI collaborations create new entities (ACT, Jan 2025)
- **Context Privilege**: Sometimes beats distributed execution (ACT, Jan 2025)
- **Metabolic States**: Digital organisms have maintenance costs (ACT, Jan 2025)

## What is WEB4?

WEB4 represents a fundamental reconception of the internet—from platform-controlled (Web2) and token-speculated (Web3) to **trust-native** and **intelligence-distributed**. 

At its core, WEB4 makes trust the fundamental force of digital interaction, like gravity in physics, binding intelligent entities into coherent systems that learn, remember, and evolve through genuine interaction rather than central declaration.

### Four Foundational Mechanisms

1. **Binding**: Permanent, unforgeable identity attachment
2. **Pairing**: Authorized operational relationships  
3. **Witnessing**: Trust building through observation
4. **Broadcast**: Discovery without commitment

## The Complete Web4 Equation

```
Web4 = LCTs + MRH + Trust + MCP + SAL + AGY + ACP + ATP + Dictionaries
```

- **LCTs** (Linked Context Tokens): Unforgeable identity and context preservation
- **MRH** (Markov Relevancy Horizon): Fractal context maintenance via RDF graphs
- **Trust**: Role-contextual T3/V3 tensors for reputation
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol): Inter-entity communication layer
- **SAL** (Society-Authority-Law): Governance with birth certificates and law oracles
- **AGY** (Agency Delegation): Formal authority transfer with proof-of-agency
- **ACP** (Agentic Context Protocol): Autonomous planning and execution
- **ATP** (Alignment Transfer Protocol): Energy-based economy with charged/discharged tokens
- **Dictionaries**: Living semantic bridges managing compression-trust relationships

## Core Concepts

### 🔑 Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)
The **reification of presence itself**. Every entity—human, AI, or hybrid—gains an unforgeable footprint in the digital realm. Your LCT is born with you, lives through your actions, and bears witness to your contributions. It cannot be stolen, sold, or transferred. It is you, crystallized in cryptographic reality.

### ⚡ Alignment Transfer Protocol (ATP/ADP)
A revolutionary economic system inspired by biological energy transfer. ATP tokens exist in charged or discharged (ADP) states, flowing through society-managed pools rather than accumulating in individual accounts. Value is created through productive work (charging ADP to ATP), consumed through R6 actions (discharging ATP to ADP), and benefits all participants fractally through T3/V3 tensor updates. Demurrage and velocity requirements prevent hoarding, ensuring value flows like energy through living systems.

### 🧠 Memory as Temporal Sensor
Memory doesn't just record the past—it **senses** it. Alongside physical sensors (spatial) and cognitive sensors (future projection), memory as temporal sensor creates the complete reality field where intelligence operates. Every interaction leaves a trace, every trace can be witnessed, and every witness strengthens the fabric of collective trust.

### 📊 T3 and V3 Tensors
**Trust** and **Value** are role-contextual and multidimensional:
- **T3 (Trust Tensor)**: Talent, Training, Temperament—capabilities in specific roles
- **V3 (Value Tensor)**: Veracity, Validity, Value—outcomes in specific contexts
- **Role-Specific**: Trust as surgeon ≠ trust as mechanic
- **ATP-Staked Queries**: Prevent reputation farming through economic commitment

### 🌐 Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)
Created by Dennis Palatov to extend Markov blankets to fractal scales, MRH maintains context across multiple levels of organization. Implemented as RDF graphs with SPARQL queries, supporting four relationship types: binding (permanent identity), pairing (operational authorization), witnessing (trust building), and broadcast (public announcement).

### 🔗 Fractal Lightchain Architecture
Hierarchical witness-based verification that scales from nanosecond cell operations to permanent blockchain anchors—all without global consensus bottlenecks. Trust emerges from witnessed interactions at every scale.

### ⚡ LRC Governance Model
A physics-inspired governance system where change resistance emerges from natural dynamics. Components have inductance (change resistance), capacitance (experimentation potential), and resistance (quality filtering), creating self-balancing systems. This README describes the Web4 instantiation while LRC provides the stack-agnostic transfer layer. [Learn more →](LRC_GOVERNANCE.md)

## A Worked Example

*Imagine a human researcher and an AI collaborator co-authoring a paper. Their roles, trust, and contributions are tracked seamlessly through LCTs. Every edit and validation flows through ATP, consuming energy when work is done, generating new energy when value is recognized. Their MRHs keep focus at the right scope: local edits for the AI, long-term framing for the human. The T3 tensors ensure each contributes where they're strongest. Together, they produce work that is verifiable, witnessed, and trusted—without any central authority. The paper itself becomes an entity with its own LCT, accumulating reputation as others cite and build upon it.*

## Key Innovations

### Roles as First-Class Entities
Roles aren't just labels—they're entities with their own LCTs, histories, and reputations. Every entity begins with a "citizen" role pairing that serves as its birth certificate, providing permanent base rights and responsibilities.

### Complete Action Grammar (R6)
Every transaction follows the R6 pattern: Rules + Role + Request + Reference + Resource → Result. This ensures deterministic, auditable, and law-compliant execution across all Web4 interactions.

### Autonomous Yet Accountable (ACP)
Agents can plan and execute autonomously through triggers, workflows, and decision trees, while maintaining human oversight gates, witness requirements, and complete audit trails on immutable ledgers.

### Society-Based Governance (SAL)
Every entity is born into a society with laws, authorities, and witnesses. Law Oracles publish machine-readable rules, creating fractal governance that scales from individuals to ecosystems.

### Formal Delegation (AGY)
Precise authority transfer where Clients delegate specific powers to Agents with exact scope, resource caps, temporal bounds, and proof-of-agency requirements for every action.

### Value as Energy (ATP/ADP Cycle)
Unlike traditional currencies designed for accumulation, ATP tokens must flow to maintain value. Societies mint ADP (discharged), producers charge it to ATP through value creation, R6 actions discharge it back to ADP, and demurrage prevents hoarding—creating an economy that rewards work over wealth.

### Semantic Bridges (Dictionary Entities)
Living entities that manage the fundamental principle: all meaningful communication is compression plus trust. Dictionaries translate between domains, track semantic degradation, evolve through community curation, and build reputation through successful service.

### Four-Tier Blockchain Typology
- **Compost** (milliseconds): Ephemeral working memory
- **Leaf** (seconds-minutes): Short-term episodic memory
- **Stem** (minutes-hours): Consolidated patterns
- **Root** (permanent): Crystallized wisdom

## Compression Trust: The Foundation of Meaning

### Core Principle
**All meaningful communication is compression plus trust across shared or sufficiently aligned latent fields.**

Compression trust unifies several critical concepts:
- **Compression**: Reducing rich input to compact representations (tokens, latents, IDs)
- **Trust**: Belief that sender and receiver's latent fields overlap enough to reconstruct intended meaning
- **Shared Latent Fields**: The common embedding spaces that enable understanding

This principle underlies:
- Human language (words as compressed symbols)
- Neural networks (token IDs pointing to embeddings)
- VAE/VQ-VAE systems (continuous vs discrete latent spaces)
- Web4 dictionary entities (shared codebooks with LCT metadata)

### The Triadic Framework
Compression trust bridges three layers:
1. **Synchronism (Theory)** - WHY compression trust is necessary for resonance between witnesses
2. **Web4 (Infrastructure)** - HOW to manage, align, and audit compression trust
3. **SAGE (Operation)** - WHAT compression trust looks like in practice (IRPs, SNARCs, pipelines)

### Key Documents
- [Compression Trust Unification](compression_trust_unification.md) - Foundational theory
- [Compression Trust Triads](compression_trust_triads.md) - The three-layer framework
- [Unification Diagram](compression_trust_unification_diagram.md) - Visual representation
- [Visual Tokenizer Path](visual_tokenizer_path_diagram.md) - VAE/VQ-VAE implementation
- [Calibration Diagram](compression_trust_calibration_diagram.md) - Cross-entity alignment

### Open Questions for Exploration

1. **How do we bootstrap trust?** When two entities first meet, how do they establish initial compression alignment?

2. **Trust degradation over time?** As models/entities evolve, how do we detect and correct drift in latent spaces?

3. **Hierarchical compression?** Can we have multiple levels of compression trust (high trust = more compression)?

4. **Meta-dictionaries?** Dictionary entities that translate between other dictionary entities?

> *"Compression without trust is noise. Trust without compression is inefficiency. Compression trust is meaning."*
