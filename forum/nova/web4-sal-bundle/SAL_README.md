# Web4 SAL Bundle
**Generated:** 2025-09-15T11:54:45.337494Z

This bundle adds the **Society–Authority–Law (SAL)** layer to the Web4 standard.

## Files
- `web4-society-authority-law.md` — normative SAL spec (citizenship genesis, authority, law-oracle, witness/auditor, immutable record, fractal inheritance, MRH edges, R6 mapping).
- `sal.jsonld` — JSON-LD @context for SAL classes and properties.
- `sal-ontology.ttl` — Turtle ontology patch for SAL terms.
- Updated core docs include "See also: SAL" link stubs for cross-navigation.

## Notes
- Ledger inclusion proofs and witness co-signatures are **mandatory** for SAL-critical events.
- Audit adjustments are **deterministic** and **evidence-bound**; appeals and caps defined by law datasets.
