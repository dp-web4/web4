# Derived Principles — Resonance Layer (Between Synchronism and Web4)

This layer collects **transfer principles** that translate Synchronism’s universals into forms that can guide engineering without binding to any specific stack.

## Pattern-Level Axioms
- **Compression–Trust Co‑variation**: Where information compresses *and* verification persists, trust emerges. (Neither alone suffices.)
- **Resonant Governance**: Change dynamics follow resonance characteristics; different knowledge sections carry different natural frequencies.
- **Continuity Witnessing**: Durable meaning emerges when multiple witnesses maintain consistent references across time and context.

## LRC Transfer (Governance Analogs)
Let sections of a living document be characterized by a triple **(L, C, R)** in [0..1]:

- **L — Inductance (Inertia)**: Resistance to change; higher L ⇒ longer review and higher thresholds.
- **C — Capacitance (Potential)**: Stored capacity for experimentation; higher C ⇒ more fast‑track lanes and iteration.
- **R — Resistance (Dissipation)**: Energy loss for low‑quality proposals; higher R ⇒ stronger penalties/quorum to filter noise.

These are **governance analogs**, not physics claims. We choose coefficients to achieve desired social dynamics while preserving Synchronism’s intent.

## Minimal Mapping (from L,C,R to Controls)
- Threshold increases with **L** and **R**, decreases with **C**.
- Review window increases with **L** and with a damping term δ = (a·L + b·R) / (1 + c·C).
- Quorum increases with **L** and **R**.
- Cost for proposing increases with **L** and **R** (discourages churn where stability is needed).
- Rejection penalty scales with **R** (dissipate low‑signal energy).
- Fast‑track reduction scales with (1 − **L**).

These mappings are stack‑agnostic and can be instantiated in Web4 (tokens, signatures, semantic compression) or any other governance substrate.
