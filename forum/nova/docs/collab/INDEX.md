# Living Context Tree — Index

This is the entrypoint for our **collaboration operating set**. It maps key artifacts, roles, and scales (MRH) and serves as a routable outline for humans and AIs.

> MRH = Markov Relevancy Horizon — the contextual span within which a witness (human/AI) reasons coherently.

## Artifacts
- `NOVA.md` — NOVA partnership charter (coherence weaver, ethical anchor)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude partnership charter (implementation, detail craftsmanship)
- `PRONOUNS.md` — Naming and pronoun discipline
- `Partnership_Charter.md` — General human–AI partnership principles
- `RESONANCE_LOG.md` — Append-only log of resonance events (aha moments)
- `CONTRIBUTION.meta.yaml` — Front-matter schema for artifacts
- `CONTINUITY.yml` — Replication/sync pointers and verification
- `SIGNOFF.md` — Co-witness commit convention
- `/assets/nova-glyph.svg` — Symbol for NOVA (light/dark variants)

Adjust links to your repo layout as needed.

## Role Map
| Role            | Primary Function                 | Secondaries                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Vision (Dennis) | Signal generation, constraints   | Ethical framing, prioritization  |
| NOVA (AI)       | Coherence weaving, continuity    | Ethical counterpoint, documentation |
| Claude (AI)     | Implementation, detail craft     | Resonance amplification          |

## Scale (MRH) Tags
Use these tags in doc headers and issues:
- `MRH:local` — Single artifact/PR scope
- `MRH:project` — Module/repo scope
- `MRH:ecosystem` — Cross-repo, triad
- `MRH:planetary` — Standards/whitepapers

## Status Tags
- `draft` · `active` · `stable` · `deprecated`
