# Web4 Private Context

## Latest Session Summary (2025-01-11)

### Completed Nova's Third Review Fixes
Successfully addressed all P0 blocking issues from Nova's review:
- Fixed truncated specifications
- Standardized crypto baseline to W4-BASE-1 (X25519/Ed25519/ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Completed canonicalization specifications
- Added pairwise W4ID lifecycle details

### Implemented Core Web4 Concepts from Whitepaper

#### MRH (Markov Relevancy Horizon)
- Implemented as dynamic relationship lists in LCTs
- Three arrays: bound, paired, witnessing
- Updates on every relationship change
- Context emerges from accumulated relationships

#### Roles as First-Class Entities
- Defined all 12 entity types
- Roles are delegative entities with their own LCTs
- Accumulate performance history
- Enable transparent labor markets through role-agent pairing

#### R6 Action Framework
- Complete specification: Rules + Role + Request + Reference + Resource â†’ Result
- Confidence calculation before execution
- T3/V3 tensor updates after completion
- Integration with all relationship mechanisms

#### T3/V3 Tensor Systems
- T3: Talent, Training, Temperament (trust dimensions)
- V3: Valuation, Veracity, Validity (value dimensions)
- Evolution mechanics through R6 actions
- Context-specific tracking

#### Broadcast Accumulators
- One-sided witnessing mechanism
- Lightweight presence validation
- Query interface for broadcast history
- Privacy-preserving design

#### Dictionary Entities
- Living keepers of meaning
- Track trust degradation in translation
- Learn from usage patterns
- Bridge semantic gaps between domains

### Documentation Created
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Concise implementation guide
- `RELATIONSHIP_GUIDE.md` - Deep dive into four mechanisms
- `R6_TENSOR_GUIDE.md` - Complete framework and tensor guide

### Key Technical Decisions
1. MRH is dynamic, not computed - stored directly in LCT
2. Roles accumulate history across performers
3. Dictionary entities embody compression-trust relationship
4. Broadcast enables passive witnessing without relationships
5. R6 provides structured interaction framework

### Implementation Status
- Core specifications: Complete
- Reference implementation: In progress
- Test vectors: Needed
- Standard ready for alpha implementation

### Next Steps Suggested
- Create reference implementation in Python
- Add comprehensive test vectors
- Write conformance test suite
- Begin IETF submission process
