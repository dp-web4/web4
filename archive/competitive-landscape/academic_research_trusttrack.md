## Abstract Summary

**Problem Statement**: As autonomous agents powered by LLMs proliferate in high-stakes domains (pharmaceuticals, legal workflows), the challenge is no longer just intelligence, but **verifiability**.

**Solution**: TrustTrack protocol that embeds structural guarantees:
- Verifiable identity
- Policy commitments
- Tamper-resistant behavioral logs
- Directly into agent infrastructure

**Paradigm**: Enables "trust-native autonomy" - treating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight.

**Architectural Transition**: Cloud → AI → Agent → Trust represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems.

## Key Concepts from Introduction

### Three Architectural Shifts in Digital Infrastructure:
1. **Cloud computing**: Abstracted away physical hardware, enabling elastic storage and scalable compute
2. **AI systems**: Leveraged infrastructure to train powerful models capable of perception and reasoning
3. **Autonomous agents**: Systems that not only infer, but also act, collaborate, and adapt with minimal human supervision

### The Agency-Accountability Asymmetry Problem:
- As agentic systems proliferate across domains (pharmaceuticals, finance, law), their operations become increasingly opaque, untraceable, and jurisdictionally fragmented
- Existing compliance frameworks—built for centralized, human-led systems—fail to scale in these environments

### TrustTrack's Approach:
- Compensates for structural labor (policies, logic flows, decision scaffolds) contributed by domain experts
- Enables fairer participation in an emerging open agency economy
- Use cases: pharmaceutical R&D, cross-border legal collaboration
- Architectural transition: Cloud → AI → Agent → Trust

## Relationship to Web4

**Key Observation**: This paper appears to be describing a **parallel or related effort** to Web4, focusing specifically on AI agent verifiability and trust-native systems.

**Similarities**:
- Focus on "trust-native" as architectural paradigm
- Emphasis on verifiable identity and behavioral logs
- Cryptographic foundations for accountability
- Multi-agent systems with provenance tracking
- Economic dimension (compensating for structural labor)

**Potential Differences**:
- TrustTrack appears focused specifically on LLM-powered autonomous agents
- Emphasis on compliance in regulated domains (pharma, legal)
- May be more focused on organizational/enterprise use cases
- Less emphasis on IoT/hardware binding (compared to Web4)

**Questions**:
1. Is TrustTrack related to or derived from Web4?
2. Is this a competing protocol or complementary work?
3. Are there shared authors or institutional connections?
4. Does TrustTrack cite or reference Web4?
