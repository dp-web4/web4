# Game Directory (Archived)

**Status**: Archived as of 2026-02-05
**Reason**: Evolved into standalone 4-life project

## What This Was

This directory contained the original Web4 game simulation - an interactive demonstration of Web4 concepts (LCT, ATP, trust tensors, societies) in a playable format.

## Where Development Continues

**Active Development**: https://github.com/dp-web4/4-life

The 4-life project is the evolution of this prototype into a standalone game/simulation with its own identity and roadmap.

## Why Archived (Not Deleted)

- Preserves historical context and design decisions
- Contains reference implementations still valuable for understanding
- Some engine code may be referenced by other parts of web4

## Key Files (Historical Reference)

- `engine/` - Core simulation engine (LCT, ATP, trust, societies)
- `demo/` - Interactive demonstrations
- `README.md` - Original documentation
- `THREAT_MODEL_GAME.md` - Security analysis specific to game
