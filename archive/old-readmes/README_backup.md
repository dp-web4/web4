# WEB4: The Trust-Native Internet

> *Where trust is earned, not granted. Where value flows to genuine contribution. Where humans and artificial intelligences collaborate as peers.*

## What is WEB4?

WEB4 represents a fundamental reconception of the internet—from platform-controlled (Web2) and token-speculated (Web3) to **trust-native** and **intelligence-distributed**. 

At its core, WEB4 makes trust the fundamental force of digital interaction, like gravity in physics, binding intelligent entities into coherent systems that learn, remember, and evolve through genuine interaction rather than central declaration.

Interactive HTML with navigation, search, and responsive design

*These links always point to the latest build. Run `make-md.sh`, `make-pdf.sh`, or `make-web.sh` in the whitepaper directory to regenerate after changes.*

## Core Concepts

### 🔑 Linked Context Tokens (LCTs)
The **reification of presence itself**. Every entity—human, AI, or hybrid—gains an unforgeable footprint in the digital realm. Your LCT is born with you, lives through your actions, and bears witness to your contributions. It cannot be stolen, sold, or transferred. It is you, crystallized in cryptographic reality.

### ⚡ Alignment Transfer Protocol (ATP)
Energy becomes value through a biological metaphor made digital. Like ATP in living cells, our protocol tracks energy expenditure and value creation in a continuous cycle. Work consumes energy, creating value, which when recognized by others, generates new energy. This is not mining or staking—it's genuine contribution recognized by genuine benefit.

### 🧠 Memory as Temporal Sensor
Memory doesn't just record the past—it **senses** it. Alongside physical sensors (spatial) and cognitive sensors (future projection), memory as temporal sensor creates the complete reality field where intelligence operates. Every interaction leaves a trace, every trace can be witnessed, and every witness strengthens the fabric of collective trust.

### 📊 T3 and V3 Tensors
**Trust** and **Value** become measurable, multidimensional:
- **T3 (Trust Tensor)**: Talent, Training, Temperament—capturing an entity's capabilities
- **V3 (Value Tensor)**: Valuation, Veracity, Validity—measuring created value

### 🌐 Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)
Each entity's contextual lens—defining what is knowable, actionable, and relevant within their scope. Not everything is relevant to everyone at all times. The MRH ensures efficient, focused interaction.

### 🔗 Fractal Lightchain Architecture
Hierarchical witness-based verification that scales from nanosecond cell operations to permanent blockchain anchors—all without global consensus bottlenecks. Trust emerges from witnessed interactions at every scale.

## Key Innovations

### Trust Through Witnessing
Trust emerges from accumulated witnessed interactions. Every action creates a witness mark, every witness can be acknowledged, creating bidirectional proof without global consensus.

### Entities Beyond Users
Anything with presence can be an entity: humans, AIs, organizations, roles, tasks, even thoughts. Each gets an LCT, making them first-class participants in the trust network.

### Memory as Living History
Memory actively perceives temporal patterns, building trust through witnessed experience. It's not storage—it's the sense that makes time itself tangible.

### Four-Tier Blockchain Typology
- **Compost** (milliseconds): Ephemeral working memory
- **Leaf** (seconds-minutes): Short-term episodic memory
- **Stem** (minutes-hours): Consolidated patterns
- **Root** (permanent): Crystallized wisdom

## Implementation Status

## Vision

In Web4:
- **You don't just have an account**—you have presence
- **You don't just perform roles**—you inhabit them
- **You don't just interact**—you leave footprints in the fabric of digital reality itself

The revolution is not in the technology alone, but in what becomes possible when every interaction carries verifiable trust, every contribution creates measurable value, and every intelligence—human or artificial—can participate as a respected peer in our collective evolution.
