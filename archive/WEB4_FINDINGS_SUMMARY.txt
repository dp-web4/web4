DEPRECATION ASSESSMENT
======================

HIGH CONFIDENCE DEPRECATED: NONE

MEDIUM CONFIDENCE STALLED:
1. /competitive-landscape/ (1.5 MB, Nov 29)
   - Incomplete Next.js scaffold
   - Missing market analysis
   - Low priority
   Action: MOVE TO ARCHIVE

2. /forum/*.pdf (280 KB)
   - Design history (valuable)
   - Not active development
   - Action: MOVE TO ARCHIVE, LINK FROM DOCS

LEGACY BUT MAINTAINED:
1. /reference/ (276 KB, Dec 5)
   - Original conceptual work
   - Overlaps with /docs/ (intentional)
   - Used for historical reference
   Action: ADD DEPRECATION NOTICE ("See /docs/ for current")

2. /demo/ (224 KB, Dec 17)
   - Functional reference implementation
   - Not actively extended
   - Useful for onboarding
   Action: ADD README NOTICE ("Maintained as reference")

DUPLICATE CONTENT ANALYSIS
===========================

CONFIRMED OVERLAPS (ALL INTENTIONAL):

1. Whitepaper versions
   - /reference/WEB4_Whitepaper_Original.md (source)
   - /whitepaper/ (built format)
   Reason: Original is reference, built is primary

2. Coordination framework
   - /game/ (simulation implementation)
   - /implementation/ (standalone research)
   Reason: Game is research context, implementation is portable

3. LCT specifications
   - /docs/LCT_UNIFIED_IDENTITY_SPECIFICATION.md (current)
   - /docs/LCT_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md (current)
   - /reference/LCT_*.md docs (historical)
   Reason: Docs/ is current spec, reference/ is exploration

4. Test files
   - /tests/, /web4-standard/testing/, /game/tests/
   Reason: Separate test suites for different subsystems

ASSESSMENT: No harmful duplicates. Clear domain separation.

FILE SYSTEM QUALITY
===================

EXCELLENT POINTS:
+ Proper .gitignore (no build artifacts tracked)
+ Clean history (no secrets)
+ Modular structure (independent components)
+ Test coverage (218 test files)
+ Documentation (371 markdown files)
+ Session tracking (named, versioned)

IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:
- Add ARCHITECTURE.md at root (component map)
- Add MAINTENANCE.md (session workflow docs)
- Create deprecation notices for legacy dirs
- Consolidate competing PDFs to archive
- Add CI/CD matrix documentation

ACTIVITY TIMELINE

Pattern: Intensive research with clear session markers

RECOMMENDATIONS PRIORITY
=======================

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
1. Move /competitive-landscape/ to archive/
2. Add deprecation notice to /reference/README.md
3. Update root README with contributor guide

SHORT-TERM (Next Sprint):
1. Create ARCHITECTURE.md (4 tracks + components)
2. Create MAINTENANCE.md (session workflow)
3. Move forum/*.pdf to archive/forum-pdfs/

MEDIUM-TERM (Quarterly):
1. Consolidate /reference/ and /docs/
2. Formalize test suite structure
3. Add performance benchmarks

LONG-TERM (When Scaling):
1. Consider monorepo split (standard vs impl)
2. Multi-org development governance
3. RFC process formalization

CLONE & SETUP ASSESSMENT
=========================

Repository Health: EXCELLENT FOR CLONING
- Proper .gitignore: No build bloat
- Clean history: No secrets
- Modular code: Independent components
- Documentation: Learning path exists
- Tests: Full test suites present
