# Reference Directory - DEPRECATED (Archived 2025-12-24)

## Why This Was Archived

This directory contains **historical documentation** from the original Web4 vision (August 2025) when the project was conceived as "MCP-LCT Integration Prototype."

Web4 has since **evolved significantly** beyond this original scope:

### Evolution Timeline

**August 2025** (this archive):
- Web4 as MCP-LCT integration prototype
- Focus on cognition pool connection
- Phase 1-4 development plan
- MCP servers as facilitator entities

**October - December 2025** (current):
- Web4-standard RFC-style specification (12 MB)
- Session 84 stress testing and adversarial validation
- Unified LCT identity specification
- Production implementation with trust routing
- Compression-trust integration
- Game/ 4-Life simulation (25k lines)
- Implementation/ research sessions

### What Happened

The original MCP-focused approach was **too narrow**. Web4 evolved into:
1. **Full RFC-style standard** (`/web4-standard/`)
2. **Research-driven implementation** (`/implementation/`)
3. **Simulation testbed** (`/game/`)
4. **Comprehensive specs** (`/docs/`)

This reference/ directory became **legacy** as the project matured.

## What's Preserved Here

**Original vision documents** (August 7, 2025):
- `README.md` - Original "MCP-LCT Integration Prototype" vision
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Early architecture concepts
- `SAGE_WHITEPAPER.md` - SAGE integration ideas
- `WEB4_Whitepaper_Original.md` - 96 KB original whitepaper
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES.md` - Phase 1-4 plan
- `MCP_LCT_INTEGRATION.md` - MCP integration design
- And other founding documents

**Historical value**: Shows Web4's origin and evolution.

**DO NOT use for current development** - Concepts may be outdated.

## Why Keep This Archive?

1. **Historical record** - Understand project evolution
2. **Founding vision** - Original insights still valuable
3. **Reference** - Compare original vs evolved concepts
4. **Learning** - Study how projects evolve from prototype to standard

**For current Web4 work, start with `/docs/` and `/web4-standard/`.**

**Archived**: 2025-12-24 during repository housekeeping
**Reason**: Evolution beyond original MCP-focused prototype
**Status**: Historical reference only
