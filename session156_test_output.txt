TEST COMPLETE
================================================================================

================================================================================
SESSION 156 COMPLETE
================================================================================
Status: ✅ ATP-enhanced internal cogitation implemented
Validation: Economic feedback works at micro (internal) scale
Insight: Cogitation is fractal - same ATP patterns at every scale
Next: Federated SAGE verification OR real network deployment
