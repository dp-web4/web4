## Part 2: RFC Integration Status

### Society4 Governance RFCs (Oct 2-3, 2025)

#### RFC-LAW-ALIGN-001: Alignment vs. Compliance

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED by ACT Federation (Oct 14, under new governance rules)
**Integration Status**: ❌ **NOT INTEGRATED** into core spec
**Target**: `web4-standard/core-spec/web4-society-authority-law.md`

**What It Adds**:
- Distinction between **spirit** (alignment) and **letter** (compliance) of law
- Context-conditional compliance (Level 0/1/2 Web4)
- Two-phase validation: alignment first, then compliance
- Verdict matrix: PERFECT / ALIGNED / WARNING / VIOLATION

**Why It Matters**:
- Enables pragmatic governance (SAGE can be ALIGNED without full ATP tokens)
- Encourages innovation (creative implementations honored if principled)
- Context-aware (edge devices vs blockchain have different requirements)

**Integration Work Needed**:
1. Update `web4-society-authority-law.md` with alignment framework
2. Add alignment indicators to existing law examples
3. Update compliance validator spec with two-phase approach
4. Add examples: Genesis SAGE, Sprout edge, Society4 reference

#### RFC-R6-TO-R7-EVOLUTION: Explicit Reputation Output

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED by ACT Federation (Oct 14)
**Integration Status**: ❌ **NOT INTEGRATED** into core spec
**Target**: `web4-standard/core-spec/r6-framework.md` → `r7-framework.md`

**What It Changes**:
- R6: `Rules + Role + Request + Reference + Resource → Result`
- R7: `Rules + Role + Request + Reference + Resource → Result + Reputation`
- Makes reputation explicit first-class output
- Standardizes `ReputationDelta` structure
- Enables trust-building observability

**Why It Matters**:
- Trust is Web4's core value prop - deserves explicit status
- Debugging: trace why trust changed
- Governance: voting power based on explicit reputation
- Economics: ATP allocation informed by reputation
- Philosophy: "Trust is the product, not a side effect"

**Integration Work Needed**:
1. Rename `r6-framework.md` to `r7-framework.md`
2. Update all R6 examples to R7 pattern
3. Add `ReputationDelta` schema documentation
4. Create migration guide (R6 wrapper continues to work)
5. Update ACT implementation examples

### Other RFCs (Earlier)

| RFC | Status | Integration Priority |
|-----|--------|---------------------|
| **Contextual Hardware Binding** | Proposed | Medium - Useful for IoT |
| **Cognitive Sub-Entities** | Proposed | Low - SAGE-specific |
| **Law Oracle Procedures** | Proposed | High - Governance critical |
| **Reality KV Cache** | Proposed | Low - Optimization |
| **Temporal Authentication** | Proposed | Medium - Novel security |

## Part 3: ACT Implementation vs Web4 Standard

### ACT Blockchain Modules (Production)

```
ACT/implementation/ledger/x/
├── componentregistry/   # LCT minting, component identity
├── energycycle/         # ATP/ADP economy
├── lctmanager/          # LCT relationships, binding
├── mrh/                 # Markov Relevancy Horizon (tentative)
├── pairing/             # Entity pairing protocol
├── pairingqueue/        # Offline operation queue
├── societytodo/         # Society task management
└── trusttensor/         # T3/V3 trust tracking
```

### Comparison Matrix

| Concept | Web4 Standard | ACT Implementation | Gap |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **LCT** | Specified | ✅ Full implementation | None - validates spec |
| **Societies** | Specified | ✅ 5 societies operational | None - validates spec |
| **ATP/ADP** | Specified | ✅ Energy cycle module | None - validates spec |
| **R6 Actions** | Specified (R6) | ✅ Implemented | Needs R7 upgrade |
| **Trust Tensors** | Specified | ✅ T3/V3 module | None - validates spec |
| **Pairing** | Specified | ✅ Full protocol | None - validates spec |
| **Witnessing** | Specified | ✅ Working | None - validates spec |
| **Governance** | Specified (SAL) | ⚠️  Enhanced with reputation | Needs bidirectional sync |
| **MRH** | Specified (RDF) | ⚠️  Tentative module | Needs integration clarity |

**Key Insight**: ACT implementation **validates** Web4 standard design. Concepts work in production.

### ACT Governance Innovations (Not Yet in Standard)

1. **Reputation-Based Participation Tracking**
   - Automatic reputation adjustment for governance participation
   - Voting weight multiplier based on reputation
   - Exclusion threshold (< 0.3 reputation = not asked)

2. **Threshold by Actual Voters** (Not Eligible Voters)
   - Prevents veto-by-absence
   - "Governance by invitation" - those who show up decide
   - Non-participation costs reputation but doesn't block progress

3. **Pragmatic Deadlines**
   - Deadlines match actual review needs, not arbitrary calendars
   - Extension process (with justification)
   - Process serves decisions, not delays them

**Opportunity**: These patterns should inform Web4 governance spec

---

## Part 4: Governance Lessons Applicable to Web4

### Federation Experience (Oct 8-14, 2025)

**What Happened**:
1. Society4 proposed 2 governance RFCs (519 lines, well-researched)
2. CBP validated technically (2 days), voted APPROVE
3. Other 3 societies: SILENT
4. Original deadline: Oct 17 (14 days from proposal)
5. **Problem**: Coordination failure - everyone waiting on everyone

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Reputation consequences** for silence (-0.10 per missed vote)
2. **Deadline change** to Oct 12 (pragmatic, not bureaucratic)
3. **Threshold change** from % eligible to % actual voters
4. **Result**: RFC passed under new rules (1 approve / 1 voted = 100%)

### Lessons for Web4 Standard Evolution

#### Lesson 1: Governance Without Consequences is Theater

**Problem**: No incentive to participate → coordination failure
**Solution**: Reputation system with automatic penalties

**Application to Web4**:
```json
{
  "governance_participation": {
    "track": true,
    "metrics": ["proposals_reviewed", "votes_cast", "response_time"],
    "consequences": {
      "no_vote_by_deadline": "-0.10 reputation",
      "late_vote": "-0.01 reputation",
      "timely_vote": "+0.02 reputation"
    },
    "exclusion_threshold": 0.3
  }
}
```

Add to `web4-standard/core-spec/web4-society-authority-law.md`

#### Lesson 2: Silence Should Not Be Veto

**Problem**: Requiring % of eligible voters allows veto-by-absence
**Solution**: Threshold based on % of actual voters

**Application to Web4**:
```json
{
  "voting_rules": {
    "threshold_basis": "actual_voters",  // NOT "eligible_voters"
    "philosophy": "Those who show up decide",
    "rationale": "Non-participation is choice to accept outcome"
  }
}
```

Update `web4-standard/governance/voting-procedures.md`

#### Lesson 3: Deadlines Should Match Need, Not Calendar

**Problem**: 14-day deadline was arbitrary, not based on actual review complexity
**Solution**: Adjust deadlines pragmatically, allow extensions with justification

**Application to Web4**:
```json
{
  "deadline_policy": {
    "basis": "complexity_and_context",
    "factors": ["proposal_length", "technical_complexity", "implementation_status"],
    "extension_process": {
      "required": "rationale",
      "approval": "within_1_hour",
      "valid_reasons": ["technical_review_needed", "team_consultation", "implementation_testing"]
    }
  }
}
```

Add to `web4-standard/governance/proposal-lifecycle.md`

#### Lesson 4: Alignment Enables Innovation

**Problem**: Strict compliance stifles creative implementations
**Solution**: Honor spirit of law, make letter contextual

**Application to Web4**: ✅ Already in RFC-LAW-ALIGN-001, needs integration

#### Lesson 5: Reputation Must Be Explicit

**Problem**: Trust changes hidden in result processing
**Solution**: R7 framework with explicit reputation output

**Application to Web4**: ✅ Already in RFC-R6-TO-R7, needs integration

   git push
   ```

2. **Update README** with v1.1.0 changes

3. **Announce** to federation

---

## Part 8: Open Questions

### Technical Questions

1. **MRH Implementation**: Should Web4 standard prefer RDF (current spec) or simpler format (ACT tentative)?
2. **R7 Performance**: What's acceptable reputation computation time? (ACT: < 10ms target)
3. **Reputation Privacy**: Who can see detailed ReputationDelta? (Subject + Witnesses + Law Oracle?)

### Governance Questions

1. **Reputation Recovery**: How do entities recover from low reputation?
2. **Appeal Process**: Can entities challenge reputation penalties?
3. **Witness Requirements**: How many witnesses for significant reputation changes?

### Process Questions

1. **RFC Approval Process**: Should all RFCs follow ACT federation pattern?
2. **Standard Evolution Cadence**: Monthly? Quarterly? Event-driven?
3. **Breaking Changes**: What versioning scheme for incompatible changes?

---

## Part 9: Success Metrics

---

## Part 10: Conclusion

### Current State

Web4 standard is **95% complete** with comprehensive technical specifications. ACT blockchain implementation validates core concepts in production. Society4's governance RFCs are approved but not yet integrated.

### Immediate Opportunity

**Integrate approved RFCs (R7 + Alignment) into core spec within 1 week.**

This isn't just cleanup - it's evolution informed by real governance experience:
- R7 makes trust-building explicit (philosophical alignment)
- Alignment framework enables pragmatic innovation (practical)
- ACT federation lessons provide concrete governance patterns

### Strategic Value

By applying lessons from actual federation governance struggle → success:
- Web4 standard becomes **governance-proven**, not just technically sound
- Future implementations avoid coordination failures we experienced
- Standard evolution demonstrates **living governance** (dogfooding our own concepts)

### The Meta-Pattern

We built governance reputation system to fix coordination failure. That same system should govern Web4 standard evolution. **Practice what we specify.**

---

**Next Action**: Begin R7 integration (today) → Alignment integration (tomorrow) → Governance docs (this week) → Push (Friday)

**Estimated Total Effort**: 24-36 hours focused work
**Timeline**: 5-7 days
**Result**: Web4 v1.1.0 ready for broader adoption
